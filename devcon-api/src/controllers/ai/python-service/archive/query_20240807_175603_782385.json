    "output": "assistant\n\nHello there! I'm Deva, your friendly search assistant for Devcon.org!\n\nRegarding your question, \"Are there any early bird discounts for Devcon tickets?\" I can tell you that there is a Raffle-Auction Presale happening from June 18 to July 9, which offers tickets at a discounted price of $299. However, it's not exactly an \"early bird\" discount, but rather a special opportunity to get tickets at a lower price.\n\nAs for other early bird discounts, I couldn't find any information on that. The ticketing process for Devcon 7 seems to be a bit more complex, with multiple waves of ticket sales and different pricing tiers. You can check out the ticketing page on devcon.org for more information on the different ticket options and pricing.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",
