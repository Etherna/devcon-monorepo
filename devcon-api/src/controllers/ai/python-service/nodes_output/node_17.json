Those who enter with the Minimum Bid\n    or do not win in the auction will enter into the raffle and have a chance at\n    winning **one of 180 Devcon tickets being distributed**.

If you bid above the reserve price but do\n      not win in the auction, you will automatically be funneled into the Raffle\n      for a ticket. If you win the Raffle, you will be able to withdraw all\n      funds above the Reserve price. If you do not win in either the Raffle or\n      Auction, you will be able to withdraw all of your funds.
