It was the largest ever Ethereum\n      gathering at the time, with just under 2000 attending in a year of\n      unprecedented growth in terms of network use, adoption and progress.\n    button: Watch\n    button_link: 'https://archive.devcon.org/archive/watch/?order=desc&sort=eventId'\n    image: /cms-assets/past-events/Cancun.png\n  - title: devcon two\n    description: >\n      Devcon 2 came alongside one of the most (in)famous moments in Ethereum's\n      early history, as a set of Denial of Service attacks were launched against\n      the network just hours before the event was set to begin. With many of the\n      most formidable builders in the ecosystem gathered together in Shanghai,\n      they helped to coordinate emergency upgrades backstage to restore full\n      functionality to the network, moments before stepping forward to speak to\n      the future of the network on stage.\n    button: Watch\n    button_link: 'https://archive.devcon.org/archive/watch/?order=desc&sort=eventId'\n    image: /cms-assets/past-events/Shanghai.png\n  - title: DΞVCON 1\n    description: >\n      Only a few months after Ethereum came to life, DΞVCON 1 was held in London\n      in November of 2015. Presenters remained hard at work on each piece of the\n      original Ethereum roadmap, early dApp teams took the stage, and supporters\n      teased the early industry adoption that was to arrive soon.\n    button: Watch\n    button_link: 'https://archive.devcon.org/archive/watch/?order=desc&sort=eventId'\n    image: /cms-assets/past-events/London.png\n  - title: DEV CON 0\n    description: >\n      It all began in Berlin. Long prior to the launch of Ethereum, the earliest\n      builders and co-founders gathered in the Kreuzberg neighborhood in late\n      November of 2014 to outline their work and designs for the future of\n      Ethereum at a meetup called \"ÐΞVcon-0\". A great resource to learn about\n      the historical context and the early ethos of the project.\n    button: Watch\n    button_link: 'https://archive.devcon.org/archive/watch/?order=desc&sort=eventId'\n    image: /cms-assets/past-events/Berlin.png\n_template: past_events\n---\n\n\n\n",
