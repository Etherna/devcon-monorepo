# Devcon Thrival Guide

### Hi Devcon community,

Welcome to the Devcon Thrival Guide.

This is your guide to help you thrive and navigate all Devcon activities. Here, you‚Äôll find details on everything from pre-registration at the venue to connecting with teams during the event, and ways to participate in discussions, games, and more.

**Still have questions after reading the Thrival Guide?**

1. First ask **DEVAi**. Deva‚Äôs alter ego will likely be able to help you. You can find her at [https://app.devcon.org/](https://app.devcon.org/).

## DEVAi

Have any questions about a talk, a speaker, or any experience at Devcon? Ask DEVAi! ü¶Ñü§ñ

Here are some ideas of what you could ask:

- If I'm new to Ethereum, which sessions are must-attends?
- Help me find sessions led by speakers from Southeast Asia.
- Can you recommend sessions where I can actively participate rather than just listen?
- Who are the most community-focused speakers or sessions here?
- If I only have an hour, what session should I not miss today?
- What sessions will challenge my thinking on blockchain and social impact?
