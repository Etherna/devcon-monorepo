In this sense, we\n    aim for the distribution outcome to be approximately 10% efficient and 90%\n    fair.\n\n\n    A big thanks to the\n    **[Fairy](https://fairyxyz.notion.site/Fairy-7f1b1725eff94829a9e50bd7c432aa8c)**\n    & **[Archblock](https://x.com/archblock_)** teams for dedicating their time\n    to the success of this year’s iteration.\n  participation_rules:\n    snapshot:\n      - left: Network\n        right: Arbitrum\n      - left: Minimum Bid\n        right: 0.08 ETH ($299 USD)\n      - left: Raffle+Auction\n        right: June 18 - July 09\n    text: >\n      All proceeds from the Auction above the reserve price will be used to help\n      people attend Devcon through funding programs like the **[EF Next Billion\n      Scholars program](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/06/07/devcon7-scholars)**\n      and other Devcon initiatives.
