  "title": "hevm or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Symbolic Execution",
  "description": "hevm is a symbolic execution engine for the EVM that can prove safety properties for EVM bytecode or verify semantic equivalence between two bytecode objects. It exposes a user-friendly API in Solidity that allows you to define symbolic tests using almost exactly the same syntax as usual unit tests.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll present hevm, what it's useful for, and when and how to use it to help secure your digital contracts.",
