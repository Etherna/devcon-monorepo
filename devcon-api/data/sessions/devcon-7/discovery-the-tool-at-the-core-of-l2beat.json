  "description": "Hands on workshop about how to use an L2BEAT tool called discovery for mapping, researching and monitoring all the contracts involved in a project. We'll start by introducing the problem that discovery tries to solve and after that we'll get into trying to understand the architecture of a real world project by using the avenues this tool gives us. After this session the participant should feel empowered to use discovery to deepen his knowledge about all on-chain deployments.",
