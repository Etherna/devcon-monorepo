  "title": "“Unified Ethereum” vs “L2 Ecosystem Competition”: Can we have both?",
  "description": "This panel will dig into the delicate balance of Ethereum's rollup-centric future. We'll talk about the \"frenemy\" dynamic between competing L2 ecosystems, and how this can lead to a fragmented user experience. We'll strategize on ways to maintain diversity while making interoperability easy for users—including a discussion on the pros/cons of supporting standards like ERC-7683. Can we get the best of both worlds: the innovation and diversity of many L2s, with the UX of a unified Ethereum?",
