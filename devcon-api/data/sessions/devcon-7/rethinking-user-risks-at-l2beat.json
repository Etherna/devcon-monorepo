  "title": "Rethinking user risks at L2BEAT",
  "description": "We want to announce a new L2BEAT feature of viewing protocol risks that individuals are actually exposed to. When we researched risks in the past users didn't find the information relevant, because they weren't aware they were using a specific protocol. Bridges are one example where users forgot about escrow risk as soon as the funds were bridged. In this talk we'll show how rollup risks translate into risks associated with individual assets held by users.",
