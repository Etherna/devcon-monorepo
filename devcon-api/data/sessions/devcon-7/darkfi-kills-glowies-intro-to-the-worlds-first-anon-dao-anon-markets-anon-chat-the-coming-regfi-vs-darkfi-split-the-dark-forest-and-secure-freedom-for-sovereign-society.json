  "description": "The FBI director gave a speech on the \"Going Dark problem\" saying that mass usage of crypto threatens to create dark zones online where law enforcement cannot enter.\r\n\r\nDarkFi created the world's first anon DAO, after our experience on AssangeDAO which raised 55 million and bankrolled Assange's freedom.\r\n\r\nWe have also made the world's strongest anon chat, and the only p2p chat which is actually used. As well as task managers and anon markets. DarkFi delivers.\r\n\r\nFight back and lets gain our freedom!",
