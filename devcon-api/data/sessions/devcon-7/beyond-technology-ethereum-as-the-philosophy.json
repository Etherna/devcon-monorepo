  "title": "Beyond technology: Ethereum as the philosophy",
  "description": "In this talk, we delve into the philosophical implications of Ethereum and attempt to draw parallels between blockchain concepts and ones in the history of thought from ancient Greece to modern theories such as posthumanism, accelerationism, speculative realism, etc. We conceptualize the philosophical core of Ethereum, which encompasses cyberpunk, solarpunk, crypto-anarchism, and technolibertarianism among others. Additionally, we identify the thirteen philosophical pillars of Ethereum.",
