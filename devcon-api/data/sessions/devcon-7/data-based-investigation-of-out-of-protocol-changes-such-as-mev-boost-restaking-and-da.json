  "title": "Data-based investigation of out-of-protocol changes such as mev-boost, restaking and DA",
  "description": "The complex out-of-protocol landscape (mev-boost / PBS, restaking, DA layers) of protocol-like changes to the Ethereum ecosystem is becoming increasingly influential and gaining traction. Many ideas are well-intentioned to improve things, but can also shift financial dynamics in favor of actors who are inventing them. Do these changes actually improve the ecosystem? Weâ€™ll present a data-based investigation to showing large scale impact and beneficiaries of these recent out-of-protocol trends.",
