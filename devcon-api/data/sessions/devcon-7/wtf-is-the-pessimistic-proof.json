  "description": "Cryptographic safety for the AggLayer requires a novel solution. Itâ€™s called the pessimistic proof and it treats all chains suspiciously.  The AggLayer will be a decentralized protocol that scales blockchains by unifying liquidity, users, and state. The Pessimistic proof is a proof generated to securely grant this shared liquidity, and it will be technically explained in this flash talk by one of the developers.",
