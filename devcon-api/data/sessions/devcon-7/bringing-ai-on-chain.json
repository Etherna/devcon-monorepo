  "description": "Ethereum serves as a settlement layer for trust. It presents itself as a great option to offer trust-as-a-service for AI agents, which are normally oriented for individual profit and non-collaborative.\r\n\r\nTo best leverage Ethereum as a building block for AI agents, we want to give a workshop focused around collaboration between agents which will focus on interacting with Prediction Markets, a particular application we at Gnosis AI believe has lots of potential.",
