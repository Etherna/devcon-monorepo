  "description": "We will overview the history and state of research on how to design a cryptoeconomic oracle that outputs a number value. One wants such tools for price oracles, but also for bringing other information on-chain, e.g. the damages to award from an on-chain insurance contract. We will look at approaches ranging from Vitalik's 2014 SchellingCoin proposal to ideas drawing from social choice theory, including based on recent research. We will explore tradeoffs including resistance to several attacks.",
