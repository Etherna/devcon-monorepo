  "title": "Scalable and sovereign EVM data: modern data engineering best practices",
  "description": "Collecting and analyzing large historical EVM datasets can pose a significant challenge. This has led many teams and individuals to outsource their data infrastructure to commercial 3rd-party platforms. However, over the past year a new style of data workflow has emerged, using entirely open source software and local-first processing. This new ecosystem of tools allow anyone to cheaply, easily, and robustly collect and analyze any EVM dataset from the comfort of their own laptop.",
