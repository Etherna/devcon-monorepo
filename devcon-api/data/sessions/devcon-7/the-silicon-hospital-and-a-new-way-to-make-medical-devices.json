  "description": "Could silicon be more effective for medical treatment than drugs someday? We think that day could be soon.  Openwater has spent nearly 9 years developing new tech to treat a range of diseases.  It's not pulse ox, fNIRs, HIFU or EEG ... it's new hard tech and it's open-source.  We will demo the tech on stage, and share with you our clinical results to date and explain how the technology works.  We expect to be in over 100 clinical trials next year.",
