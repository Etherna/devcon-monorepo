  "title": "Dark DAOs and Private Coordination",
  "description": "Dark DAOs allow for undetectable private coordination and are feasible to launch in Ethereum today. In this talk, I will introduce Dark DAOs, the threat they pose to Ethereum, and importantly also the ways we can harness them as mechanisms for positive private coordination. I will also introduce proofs of complete knowledge as a currently available, but underused, defense against Dark DAOs.",
