  "description": "The EVM Object Format (EOF) aims to improve and enhance the EVM. Though supported for their benefits, concerns remain about their impact and added complexity. Panelists will discuss the pros and cons of such changes, governance, priorities for upcoming Ethereum hard forks, testing requirements, decision-making; and whether EVM changes should be (first) implemented in Layer 2 solutions rather than the core protocol, if L2s can effectively adopt these changes and their potential long-term outcome",
