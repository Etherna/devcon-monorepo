  "title": "VADCOPs: Leveraging STARKs for Tailored Proof Generation",
  "description": "VADCOP is a proving method using STARKs to achieve cost-efficiency by focusing on active parts of the execution trace rather than the entire trace. Traditional modular designs, which divide machines into components and use relational arguments, face inefficiencies due to the padding of unused cells with dummy values. VADCOPs optimize performance by allowing maximum modularity and avoiding unused components, making proof generation precise and efficient without unnecessary redundancy.",
