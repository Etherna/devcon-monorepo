  "description": "Learning Web3 programming. There are so many different tools and protocols to learn. Zero to Dapp is a workshop series that builds upon collaboration between different projects to guide the students from zero to their first Dapp. In this workshop, we review our learning from previous editions to encourage others give their own Zero to Dapp. Then we'll give a shortened version - usually, this workshop takes between a half day up to two full days. But we are fast learners at DevCon, arenâ€™t we? ;)",
