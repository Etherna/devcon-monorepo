  "title": "Dark winter: why the risk of unnatural pandemics is an existential threat",
  "description": "The past history of pandemics and biological attacks, lab accidents and epidemics show a recurrent theme of denial, silence and cover-up around unnatural epidemics and the powerful vested interests at play. Quantum advances in genetic engineering and synthetic biology may lead to a future where resurrection of extinct viruses are the norm. The risk of unnatural pandemics is greater than ever and poses an existential threat. Early warnings of epidemics through OSINT can help mitigate the risk.",
