  "title": "Introducing Provable Object Data",
  "description": "Built on learnings from experimental projects like Zupass, Provable Object Data (POD) is a new format with open-source libraries for any app to issue verifiable data, and make ZK proofs of claims about that data. PODs allow arbitrary key/value data to be signed and distributed.  Flexible proofs about PODs can be created using a highly-configurable family of General Purpose Circuits (GPCs), without app-specific circuits or trusted setup.  This talk will focus on POD and GPC motivation and design.",
