  "title": "Scaling autonomous worlds - building the foundations… and sewers for millions of inhabitants",
  "description": "One tends to think of Ethereum scaling in financial terms—how many transactions per second? What’s the TVL? How much liquidity?\r\n\r\nBut in a possible future where Ethereum applications extend beyond finance, into areas like autonomous worlds, games, and social, what does scaling look like and what challenges await?\r\n\r\nJoin us as we explore challenges, solutions, and open questions in this space—how do we bring latency down despite seconds-long block time? Could we shard an app across multiple chains?",
