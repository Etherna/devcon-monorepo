  "description": "Token-based voting mechanisms employed by DAOs can encounter three potential problems: plutocracy, Sybil attacks and vote buying. If one were to design a voting mechanism from scratch, how does one ensure that these issues are addressed adequately down the road? This talk aims to provide some intuition for the trade-offs faced when tackling these problems in general, and the role of time commitment in alleviating these issues, in particular.",
