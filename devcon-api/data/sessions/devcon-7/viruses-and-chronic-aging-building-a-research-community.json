  "description": "Did you know that mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and cognitive decline are directly accelerated by viruses? In fact, the viruses that infect us over a lifetime are technically not even alive, and therefore must “hack” our human cellular metabolism machinery to do anything at all. This talk will overview the first-ever global collaborative network studying & treating chronic viruses as drivers of aging, including how certain lifespan-promoting drugs may help combat viral activity.",
