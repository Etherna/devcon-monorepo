  "description": "This presentation will discuss the findings of the academic paper \"Tending the Infinite Garden: Organisational Culture in the Ethereum Ecosystem\" by Dr. Paul-Dylan-Ennis and Ann Brody. Our study examines the decision-making processes fundamental to Ethereum's protocol governance, drawing on interviews with Ethereum's core developers. We identify a central worldview in Ethereum known as the \"Infinite Garden\" and discuss how Ethereum's social layer is crucial for upholding cypherpunk values.",
