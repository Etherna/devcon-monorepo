  "title": "Enhancing Ethereum P2P Network Security through Fuzzing",
  "description": "Security is a big deal for Ethereum's p2p network. We think fuzzing is a great way to make it more secure. We developed a time-series-based fuzz testing tool for the Ethereum network layer. In this tool, we integrated mutation mechanisms and seed selection algorithms, and introduced a new time-series feedback model. Using this tool, we can spot and fix existing vulnerabilities while also spotting new risks.",
