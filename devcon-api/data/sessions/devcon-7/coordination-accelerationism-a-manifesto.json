  "description": "In this talk, we place crypto in the context of evolutionary timescale. We present an overview of the various types of coordination systems, their advantages and weaknesses. The most robust type of coordination mechanism is something we term as, self-enforcing coordination systems (SECS) - which do not require an authority, a committee or even a majority of entities to enforce the conditions of coordination. We also show how to build the most general form of SECS.",
