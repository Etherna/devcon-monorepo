  "description": "Web3 security is at a critical juncture. With millions of dollars and sensitive assets at stake, we‬\r\n‭ must shift our mindset from reactive to proactive security. Attendees will walk away from this talk‬\r\n‭ with a deeper understanding of how attackers exploit the current ecosystem and, more‬\r\n‭ importantly, how to close these gaps with practical, forward-thinking solutions. This talk will be a‬\r\n‭ wake-up call for anyone who thinks we’re doing enough to secure Web3—and a blueprint for‬\r\n‭ how we can",
