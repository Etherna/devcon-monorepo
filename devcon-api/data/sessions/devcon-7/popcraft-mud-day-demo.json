PopCraft is a fully on-chain casual click-based game integrating gameplay with financial elements. Currently in single-player mode, it plans to expand to multiplayer. Built on composability, PopCraft uses PixeLAW, TCM, and Redswap. In-game item issuance and trading are decentralized, transparent, and open, allowing seamless integration of any ERC-20 token projects and DEX.",
