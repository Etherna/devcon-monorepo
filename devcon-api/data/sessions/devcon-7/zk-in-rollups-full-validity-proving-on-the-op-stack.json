  "title": "ZK in Rollups: Full Validity Proving on the OP Stack",
  "description": "Historically, zkEVM rollups have been difficult to build, requiring deep cryptography expertise that makes customization and maintainability complicated and time-consuming. With advancements in zk, zkVMs make it easy for any developer to write ZK applications with Rust. With a zkVM, we've created seamless way to upgrade ANY existing OP Stack chain to use ZKPs in just 1 hour. These rollups get fast finality, cost-effective (<0.1 cent / tx), and full EVM equivalence.",
