  "title": "L2 Interoperability via Collaborative SNARKs",
  "description": "Can contracts across rollups interact synchronously while maintaining horizontal scalability? The L2 interoperability problem can be viewed through the lens of collaborative SNARKs, where a coordinator splits a witness over N provers who collectively generate a proof, and the work each prover does should decrease linearly in N (horizonal scaling). This talk presents a solution for the special case of L2 interoperability and motivates new design constraints for SNARKs.",
