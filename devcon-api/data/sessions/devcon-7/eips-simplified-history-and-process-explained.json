We'll explore the interesting history of EIPs and the important moments that have shaped different types and categories of proposals. Learn how EIPs go from an idea to becoming part of the Ethereum network, and see how editors help improve the standardization process. This talk is perfect for anyone who wants to learn about EIPs without getting into technical details.",
