  "description": "As a designer at the EF for the past 5 years, Iâ€™ve witnessed the unique culture of Ethereum and its growth. My talk aims to illuminate the vast cultural landscape of our ecosystem such as Cypherpunk, Regen, Degen, and L2s as subculture. I'm hoping to assist ecosystem participants, especially new comers, in becoming the infinite game players in the Infinite Garden.",
