  "title": "Comparative Institutional Analysis of Slashing Penalties on Proof-of-Stake Networks",
  "description": "With the support of the Ethereum Foundation, we have performed an analysis of slashing penalties on the fifty largest proof-of-stake cryptocurrency networks. Using insights from institutional economics and game theory, we consider variance in slashing penalties in terms of the conditions that trigger slashing, the magnitude of penalties contemplated, and the limited cases where human judgment plays a role in determining such penalties.",
