  "title": "Crypto Twitter is Wrong: This is How Rollups *Really* Work",
  "description": "It's 2024, L2s are a critical part of the Ethereum scaling roadmap, and everyone *still* gets Rollups completely wrong. If you think that Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups are real things, that Rollups need sequencers to create blocks, or that Rollups need proofs to be secure, you've been completely and utterly bamboozled by the Crypto Twitter intelligentsia. It's time we take back the truth - this is How Rollups *Really* Work.",
