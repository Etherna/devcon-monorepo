  "description": "We study the risks of validator reuse across multiple services in a restaking protocol. We characterize the robust security of a restaking network as a function of the buffer between the costs and profits from attacks. We also provide local analogs of these guarantees that apply specifically for a target service or coalition of services. Our results suggest measures of robustness that could be exposed to the participants in a restaking protocol. Full paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21785",
