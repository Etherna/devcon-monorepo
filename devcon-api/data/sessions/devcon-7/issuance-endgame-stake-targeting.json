  "description": "This talk explores the status quo of staking economics, its drawbacks as we see them and what the endgame of staking economics could look like. \r\n\r\nWe argue that it should include an issuance policy that targets a range of staking ratios instead. The intention is to be secure enough but avoid overpaying for security and thereby enabling said negative externalities.",
