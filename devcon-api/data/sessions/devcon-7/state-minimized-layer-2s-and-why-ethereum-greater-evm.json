  "title": "State Minimized Layer-2s and Why Ethereum > EVM",
  "description": "Ethereum is at a critical juncture in its development. Many layer-2s are of the same mentality of copy and pasting their architecture and have not innovated over key blockchain problems such as parallel execution or state growth. If Ethereum is to compete with other alternative high performance blockchains, it has to solve for state growth. This talk will explore the landscape of state minimized layer-2s and show how Ethereum will be able to go beyond the state problem with non-EVM based design.",
