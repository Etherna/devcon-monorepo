  "description": "For years our community is using cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies trying to build solutions that will bring people control over their digital identities. How far have we got?\r\n\r\nThis talk would like to expose a gap that exists between our Cypherpunk approach to SSI and what a real world project needs / wants / can do.\r\n\r\nIf we want our SSI solutions to bring control over their digital identities back to people, it seems we need to take a different approach.",
