  "title": "Bring public auditability into MPC (multi party computation)",
  "description": "In multi-party computation (MPC), participants can collaboratively compute without revealing their private inputs. To ensure the secure use of MPC on a blockchain, it's essential to prevent participants from colluding to manipulate results. We have developed a \"publicly auditable\" version of SPDZ, a widely-used MPC protocol, which enables third-party verification of MPC results.\r\nAdditionally, we will demonstrate application examples using our development.",
