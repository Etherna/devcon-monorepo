It aims to answer the following questions:\r\n- What software to run? How can this be customized?\r\n- What would need to go into writing a builder from the ground up?\r\n- How does one acquire orderflow? What is the relative value of various sources of orderflow?\r\n- What infrastructure is required? How much does it cost?",
