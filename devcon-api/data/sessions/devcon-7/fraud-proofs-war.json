  "description": "Fraud proof systems were originally envisioned to be able to protect a rollup with just a single honest challenger assumption. As it turns out, the matter is much more complex because of exhaustion attacks, a form of sybil attack where the attacker tries to win by economically outlasting the defenders. The talk discusses the tradeoffs in the proposed solutions to this form of attack by analyzing Arbitrum, Cartesi and Optimism fraud proof systems.",
