  "description": "In this talk, the speaker will discuss the problems encountered in porting Grandine, an Ethereum consensus client, to Windows systems and the solutions from the perspectives of language, engineering, and cross-platform. The speaker found that these problems are common to the current Ethereum infrastructure based on the Rust language. Finally, the speaker will summarize and look forward to the development of Ethereum clients based on the Rust language, especially from the point of cross-platform.",
