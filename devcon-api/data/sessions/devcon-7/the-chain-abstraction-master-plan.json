  "description": "Chain abstraction is vital for Ethereum’s future competitiveness and interoperability. This talk will dive into why Ethereum apps need chain abstraction to avoid fragmentation and ensure open, trustless, and modular systems. We’ll explore approaches to abstraction, the importance of open standards, and a roadmap for upgrading the ecosystem’s core infrastructure—spanning JSON-RPC API improvements, resource locks, and intent settlement—to unlock new layers of usability and decentralization.",
