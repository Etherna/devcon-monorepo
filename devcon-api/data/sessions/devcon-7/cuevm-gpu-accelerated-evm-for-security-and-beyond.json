  "title": "CuEVM: GPU-Accelerated EVM for Security and Beyond",
  "description": "In this talk, we present CuEVM, an EVM executor implemented in CUDA for running a massive number of transactions in parallel. Its primary application is to accelerate fuzzing by testing transactions in multiple sandbox EVMs on GPUs. Additionally, we have integrated it into Goevmlab to support a broader range of use cases. We will discuss the design choices, challenges, results, and future plans to leverage CuEVM beyond fuzzing.",
