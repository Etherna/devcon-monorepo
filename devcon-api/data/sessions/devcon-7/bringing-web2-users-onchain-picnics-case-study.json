  "description": "Account abstraction had mixed success so far. Some specific purpose apps have been getting great usage, but there is still little economic value being transacted using account abstraction and very low repeat usage.\r\n\r\nBy building Picnic, we discovered that account abstraction is currently much better suited to bring web2 users onchain than to cater for crypto natives. We'll share our learnings from the trenches and offer builders a fresh perspective on how to accelerate adoption.",
