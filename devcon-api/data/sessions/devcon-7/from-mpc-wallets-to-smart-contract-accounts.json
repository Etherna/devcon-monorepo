  "title": "From MPC Wallets to Smart Contract Accounts",
  "description": "The proposal outlines a path for the mass adoption of smart contract accounts by using MPC wallet as a transitional solution. Users can start their web3 journey by using MPC wallets which can be done via social login. Later, users can turn the MPC wallets into smart contract wallets using EIP-7702, enhancing the user experience with feature-rich options while maintaining the security benefits of MPC wallets to protect the EOA private key.",
