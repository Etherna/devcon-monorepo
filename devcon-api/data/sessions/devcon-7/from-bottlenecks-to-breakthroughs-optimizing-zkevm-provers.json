  "title": "From Bottlenecks to Breakthroughs: Optimizing zkEVM Provers",
  "description": "In this session, we introduce how we optimized zkEVM provers in production to significantly reduce prover costs, a major expense in running zkEVM. Topics include diagnosing zkEVM bottlenecks using CPU and memory profiling, leveraging DAGs for parallelization, and efficient memory management with a memory pool, fine-tuned garbage collection, and in-memory swapping for gigantic memory usage. These optimizations reduced zkEVM prover runtime by 75%, representing a substantial performance gain.",
