  "title": "Advancing OP Stack to ZK Rollup: Achieving Efficiency and Security with Zero Knowledge Proofs",
  "description": "OP-stack based rollups now retrieve L1-to-L2 deposit transactions and L2 transactions from Blobs. Current solutions face two issues: 1) increased operational costs due to batch submission overhead or 2) protocol complexity during challenges. We'll share our experience addressing these using ZK fault proof. Our new challenge system is cost-free for users and easily extendable to ZK rollups. The presentation includes our example of switching from zkEVM to zkVM and optimizing proof generation speed",
