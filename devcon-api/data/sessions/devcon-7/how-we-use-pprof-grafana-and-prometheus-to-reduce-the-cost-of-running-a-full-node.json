  "title": "How we use pprof, grafana and prometheus to reduce the cost of running a full node",
  "description": "Running a full node is a fundamental component of participating in a decentralized network. However, the operational cost associated with running a full node can be prohibitively high, even for an archive node, it needs a lot of CPU/Memory and SSD disks. At our organization, we have successfully implemented a cost reduction strategy by using the pprof tool, along with grafana and prometheus in our node infrastructure.",
