  "title": "Architecting Privacy-First CBDCs: Leveraging ZKPs and Ethereum for Next-Gen Digital Currencies",
  "description": "This talk explores how central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can leverage zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Ethereum to create privacy-centric monetary systems. We'll examine how ZKPs enable robust AML/CTF compliance while preserving user privacy, discuss the benefits of Ethereum deployment for financial inclusion and innovation, and showcase how these technologies could revolutionize digital currency design. Future CBDCs can and should offer unparalleled privacy, security, and functionality.",
