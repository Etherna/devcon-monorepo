  "title": "Achieving Chain Abstraction through Transaction Orchestration",
  "description": "Achieving chain abstracted experiences will require the ability to execute multiple transactions across multiple blockchains as a single \"action\", ideally with a single signature used for permissioning. \r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll explore the concepts of transaction orchestration and single-signature, multi-chain permissioning. I will present what are the benefits, how to create such systems and what are the drawbacks (e.g. soft atomicity, stale permissions, etc...)",
