  "title": "Onchain Capital Allocation: From current mechanisms to future possbilities",
  "description": "Capital allocation, from paying bills to complex organizational funding, often suffers from inefficiencies and lack of transparency. Web3 has the potential to revolutionize this by enabling more efficient, effective, and transparent capital distribution. By addressing coordination failures and introducing new onchain strategies, crypto could transform how society allocates resources.\r\n\r\nGitcoin founder Kevin Owocki will articulate this design space in this 20 minute talk.",
