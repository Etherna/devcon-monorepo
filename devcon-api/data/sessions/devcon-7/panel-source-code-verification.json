  "description": "Source code verification is the basis of trustlessness and transparency in blockchains.\r\nMany projects do source code verification but there hasn't been much collaboration and public interaction. The panel will bring members from the new collective \"Verifier Alliance\" together to create an open discussion.\r\n\r\nTopics include open-data and open-source, standardization, future challenges like state and data growth, multichain, monetization, and financial sustainability",
