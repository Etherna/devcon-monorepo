  "description": "This short panel will explore the role of advanced programmable cryptography, beyond ZK and MPC, in d/acc. Programmable cryptographic primitives like functional encryption (FE), witness encryption (WE), and indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) have become theoretically feasible and even moving towards real-world practicality. This panel will explore how these primitives can be used to improve trust-minimized infrastructure and applications.",
