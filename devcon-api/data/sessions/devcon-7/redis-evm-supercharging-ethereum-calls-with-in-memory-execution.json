  "title": "Redis EVM: Supercharging Ethereum calls with in-memory execution",
  "description": "Redis EVM is a research project that embeds an Ethereum Virtual Machine interpreter within Redis using Lua-based Functions. By enabling Redis to directly interpret EVM opcodes, this innovation aims to drastically reduce SLOAD latency for eth_call operations. We'll explore the architecture, implementation challenges, and potential performance gains of this novel approach. Come discover how Redis EVM could reshape Ethereum execution environments, enhancing scalability and efficiency for dApps.",
