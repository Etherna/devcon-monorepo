  "title": "Road to Effective Public Goods Funding through Quantitative Cross-Comparative Analysis of Grants Programs",
  "description": "I aim to achieve effective public goods funding by comparing grants models. Grants programs are key in the crypto ecosystem, but comparative studies are rare. Our study compares Uniswap, dYdX, Optimism, Gitcoin, and more, categorizing them into \"top-down,\" \"bottom-up,\" and \"QF (algorithmic)\" types. Findings suggest bottom-up and QF types distribute funds more evenly with smaller variability and grant amounts, while top-down types show greater variability with larger grants for fewer grantees.",
