  "description": "Statelessness could be one of the biggest unlocks in the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing the protocol to scale massively without giving away control and access to big entities, all while providing some real 'teeth' to the light client ecosystem.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll see how stateless clients enable immediate scalability and decentralization benefits, and how combining statelessness with ZKing the state transitions unlocks Ethereum’s long-term vision.",
