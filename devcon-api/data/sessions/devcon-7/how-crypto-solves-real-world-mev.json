  "description": "This session will discuss \"real world\" MEV applications of crypto. I highlight three examples in particular:\r\n\r\n-Event ticketing, a multi-billion dollar market place where ZK Proofs and Trusted Execution Environments have a promising role to play. \r\n-Negotiations using crypto-enforceable non-disclosure agreements (joint design with Andrew Miller)\r\n-And finally, *maximizing* Web2 MEV by allowing trustless account permissioning, e.g. on x.com\r\n\r\nEach example has a spec and a working demo with code.",
