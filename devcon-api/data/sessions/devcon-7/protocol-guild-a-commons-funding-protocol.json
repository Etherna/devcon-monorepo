  "title": "Protocol Guild: A commons funding protocol",
  "description": "Ethereum produces two shared commons resources: a blockchain network + its underlying software. These resources are inherently un-ownable, so actors will try to capture their production processes.\r\n\r\nProtocol Guild is a compelling funding protocol. Its membership is holistic, self-curated, accessible, self-governed. The mechanism adds certainty and agency into the stewardship funding process, and gives tools to defend against capture.",
