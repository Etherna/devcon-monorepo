  "description": "We will present Sonobe, a modular folding-schemes library. It currently features implementations of Nova, CycleFold, Hypernova and ProtoGalaxy schemes and is compatible with a wide range of R1CS arithmetization libraries. we will briefly discuss what folding schemes are and how they fit into IVC-style proof systems. Next, we will explain how Sonobe was built and what features it supports. Finally, we will cover what has been built with Sonobe and how developers can start using it today.",
