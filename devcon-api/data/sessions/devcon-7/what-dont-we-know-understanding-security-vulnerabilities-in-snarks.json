  "title": "What don't we know? Understanding Security Vulnerabilities in SNARKs",
  "description": "Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have evolved from being a theoretical concept providing privacy and verifiability to having practical, real-world implementations, with SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) emerging as one of the most significant innovations. Prior work has mainly focused on designing more efficient SNARK systems and providing security proofs for them. Many think of SNARKs as \"just math,\" implying that what is proven to be correct and secure is correct in practice.",
