  "title": "Optimism Retro Funding: So Far, So Good, So What!?",
  "description": "So far, over 50M OP has been awarded to projects with no strings attached. So good, another 800M OP is planned for future rounds. So what ... is the impact? My talk will offer an objective, data-driven perspective on the \"so what\" of Optimism's Retro Funding. It will include analysis on how different cohorts of projects have performed longitudinally across a variety of growth and quality metrics, while controlling for different funding and market-related effects.",
