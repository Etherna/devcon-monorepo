  "title": "Protocol MEV Capture: Execution Tickets vs Execution Auctions",
  "description": "Ethereum faces a principal-agent problem where the protocol creates MEV but leaks it to proposers, exposing the system to externalities like timing games. Properly capturing and redistributing MEV is crucial for Ethereum's evolution. Potential solutions include ETs, EAs, and ePBS.\r\n\r\nI have been working with some EF folks and crypto researchers on economic research of these protocols and want to discuss the latest advancements in this area.",
