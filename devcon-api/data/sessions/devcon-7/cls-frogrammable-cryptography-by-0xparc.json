  "description": "Underlying the FROGCRYPTO activations throughout the Devcon week are different programmable cryptography primitives. For instance, the frogs collected via Zupass differ significantly from those that interact in Frogzone.\r\n\r\nAt the Frogrammable Cryptography CLS, we will break down these different primitives through technical talks, lightning sessions, and hands-on workshops. We will also offer a glimpse of what is coming next, including cryptographic primitives like iO and new ways to build digital",
