  "description": "Let's face it, ZK proofs are intimidating. But they don't have to be!\r\nZK proofs are complex not because of the depth math they use, but because of the large number of fields of mathematics they leverage features from.\r\nIn this talk, we'll break down STARK proofs into simple blocks and colorful analogies so that you get a good high level overview of how they work",
