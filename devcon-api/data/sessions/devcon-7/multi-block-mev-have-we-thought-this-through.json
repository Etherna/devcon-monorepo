  "description": "Multi-block MEV (MMEV) means that builders secure k-consecutive blocks to extract value or compose attacks by ordering or censoring transactions across multiple blocks. \r\n\r\nThe concept has remained largely theoretical thus far. In this lightning talk, we present new data showcasing how the concept has evolved with the increasing sophistication of searcher/builders.\r\n\r\nWe present three attack-vectors, unique to MMEV and evaluate their potential harm for applications on Ethereum.",
