  "title": "The Future of AI: Why We Need Private, Uncensored, Permissionless AI",
  "description": "The current path of AI development leads to a future where a few powerful companies control this transformative technology, with the potential to become the arbiter of truth, manipulate and monetize private user data, and moderate who has access to the future of intelligence.\r\n\r\nNo entity, private or public, should have the power to monopolize or contextualize truth. Open-source, uncensored, and decentralised AI is impervious to political fancy and ideology, and offers a necessary alternative.",
