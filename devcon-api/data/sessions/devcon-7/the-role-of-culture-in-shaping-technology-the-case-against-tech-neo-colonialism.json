  "title": "The role of culture in shaping technology - the case against tech-neo-colonialism",
  "description": "Who builds technology and for whom? In decentralized technology, we must apply the cypherpunk ethos not only to the product we want to provide to the world but also to the manner we build that product. We must avoid imposing our worldview onto different cultures, or we risk reinventing tech neocolonialism. This talk will illustrate the risks of concentration of power and tech within our industry into the hands of a few cultures and present ways to build a truly cypherpunk future.",
