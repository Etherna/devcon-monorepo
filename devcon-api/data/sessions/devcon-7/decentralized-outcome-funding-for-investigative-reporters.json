  "description": "Drawing upon the idea of impact certificates, this talk demonstrates how blockspace can be leveraged to solve double selling of impact (create change once and sell to many funders) and donating on brand rather than outcomes created. The session will go through a demo built by VoiceDeck in collaboration with the EF to help traditional newsrooms port their private database of impact as Hypercerts on Optimism, so they can receive funding based on recorded impact arising from their past stories.",
