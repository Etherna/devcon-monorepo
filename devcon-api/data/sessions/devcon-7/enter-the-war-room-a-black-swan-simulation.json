  "description": "BREAKING: A key Layer 2 sequencer has suffered a complete outage for a brief period! As a consequence, many loans from the protocol DevaLend could not be paid, leading to liquidations and bad debt.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, you will assume the role of one of the key players in this exciting simulation, and explore how to navigate through it. Propose how to navigate through the DevaLend situation and react as new scenarios evolve and respond to your ideas. Good Luck!",
