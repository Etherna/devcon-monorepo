  "description": "Revm is a critical component of the Ethereum ecosystem, used by most builders, toolings and a client. It is an audited and proven library that is fast, easy to use and it is irreplaceable in the things it offers.\r\n\r\nAs time goes on, with more and more dependencies I am feeling the burden of breaking changes, and a need for consolidating its functionality, that is why I am thinking about Revm Endgame. A way to support experimentation, L2 features and EIPs without repository forking.",
