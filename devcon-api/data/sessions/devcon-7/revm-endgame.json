  "description": "Revm is a critical component of the Ethereum ecosystem, used by builders, toolings and clients. It is an audited and proven library that is both fast and easy to use.\r\n\r\nAs more projects adopt Revm, I feel the increasing burden of making breaking changes and the need to consolidate its functionality. Thatâ€™s why I am thinking about Revm Endgame, a solution to support experimentation, Layer 2 features, and EIPs without the need for repository forks.",
