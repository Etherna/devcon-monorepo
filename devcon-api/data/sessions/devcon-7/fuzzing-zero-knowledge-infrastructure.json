  "description": "Zero-knowledge (ZK) infrastructure is highly complex and highly critical for the correct operation of L2 chains; that is, a single bug can result in massive financial and reputational damage. To find such potential million-dollar bugs before they are exploited, we have developed a novel fuzzing technique that can find logic flaws that impact liveness or safety of ZK infrastructure. Our fuzzer has already found such issues in several ZK systems, including Circom, Corset, Gnark, and Noir.",
