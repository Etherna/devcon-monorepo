  "title": "Bringing new users onchain with account abstraction: Picnicâ€™s case study",
  "description": "Account abstraction is having mixed success so far. Specific purpose apps have been getting great usage, but there is still little economic value being transacted using account abstraction and a cemetery of zombie projects.\r\nBy building Picnic, we discovered that account abstraction is currently much better suited to bring new users onchain than to cater for crypto natives. We'll share our learnings from the frontlines and offer builders a fresh perspective on how to accelerate adoption.",
