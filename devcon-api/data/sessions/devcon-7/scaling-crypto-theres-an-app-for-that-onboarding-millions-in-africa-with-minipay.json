  "title": "Scaling Crypto? There's an App for That. Onboarding Millions in Africa with MiniPay",
  "description": "Post-EthCC, everyone’s talking about the industry’s influx of infra & lack of consumer apps. These conversations overlook the strides made in Africa with MiniPay, a self-custodial stablecoin wallet with 3M+ activated accounts since launching less than a year ago. In this panel, Rene, Yoseph & co-panelists will discuss building, scaling, & updating a truly user-friendly crypto wallet, introducing net new users to Web3 and dApps, & the power of ERC-20 stablecoins for payments in emerging markets.",
