  "description": "Vitalik believes \"ethereum's biggest technical risk probably is bugs in code, and anything that could significantly change the game on that would be amazing\".  Formal verification is a key technology which many believe could significantly help.  However, it has yet to see wide adoption for a variety of reasons.  This panel will bring together formal verification experts working in blockchain to discuss the challenges faced in increasing the use of formal verification within the community.",
