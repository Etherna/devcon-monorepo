  "title": "Client-side ZK Proving and its Applications: Experiments from ZK Email",
  "description": "We share our attempts at client-side ZK proving and its potential applications. This is significant for users to generate proofs without revealing private information to any external server. We have explored multiple solutions for client-side proving and have learned many lessons on generating proofs for non-small circuits with reasonable latency and memory consumption in a browser. The practical client-side proving will unlock new applications using signed data such as emails.",
