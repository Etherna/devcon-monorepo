  "description": "Giga is a joint venture between UNICEF and the ITU with the mission of connecting all the world's schools to the internet. Over the past years, a novel approach to fund the ongoing operating expenses of school connectivity has been running as a pilot in Rwanda and Giga is currently scaling up operations.\r\n\r\nAs part of this pilot, one staking node has been generating returns that are being spent on connectivity in a school in Rwanda. All of this has been done in compliance with local regulations.",
