  "title": "Time is all you need: optimizing Dutch auctions on Arbitrum",
  "description": "Dutch auctions are a common approach in MEV-mitigating mechanism designs. However, little work has been done in exploring the optimal auction execution times, as well as optimal decay curves, for blockchain based trading. Using simulations and real data, we present our findings on this topic, as well as proposed solutions to achieve the optimal outcomes.",
