  "title": "Hunt the Bug, Save the Chain: Uncovering Bugs in EIP Implementations",
  "description": "In this workshop you can find a bug in an EIP implementation on a test network!\r\n\r\nThe Ethereum Foundation Testing Team oversees cross-client execution specification testing, which is critical to avoid consensus issues at the smart-contract execution level.\r\n\r\nYou'll implement tests for a new EIP from scratch using the ethereum/execution-spec-tests framework and execute them on a local test network with a faulty client. Anyone attending has the chance to find the issue and break the network!",
