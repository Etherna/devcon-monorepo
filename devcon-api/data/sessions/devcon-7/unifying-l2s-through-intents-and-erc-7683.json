  "title": "Unifying L2s Through Intents and ERC-7683",
  "description": "Ethereum has scaled with a diverse ecosystem of L2s—but this created a new challenge: how can this fragmented landscape of potentially millions of rollups feel like a **unified Ethereum**? In this talk, I’ll discuss how intent-based architectures—and new standards like ERC-7683—can help unify Ethereum while maintaining the benefits of Ethereum’s rollup centric architecture.",
