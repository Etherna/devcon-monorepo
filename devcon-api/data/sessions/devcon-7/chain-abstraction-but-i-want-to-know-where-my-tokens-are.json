  "description": "As a space, we face a big problem: how should we think about where assets live. Is Eth different from oEth or aEth. Does it matter where Circle prints your USDC? Should chains delegated to the kind of infra that Google Cloud or AWS is today? Clearly, the fragmentations of USDC/USDT/xDAI and then all the L2s creates horrible UX. However, the underlying assets are different things and the chains they live on have completely different security guarantees. Let's fix this!",
