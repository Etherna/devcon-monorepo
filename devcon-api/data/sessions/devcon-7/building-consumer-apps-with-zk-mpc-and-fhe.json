  "title": "Building Consumer Apps with ZK, MPC, and FHE",
  "description": "In this panel, members of Cursive, ZKP2P, Zupass, and ZK-Email will describe their experience building and enabling consumer applications using programmable cryptography. They will discuss how advances in ZK, MPC, and FHE enable new types of applications to be built, how to get started building apps and tradeoffs in tooling, as well as the challenges and potential pitfalls while using these tools. Finally, they'll share some future ideas for cryptography-centric apps they're excited about!",
