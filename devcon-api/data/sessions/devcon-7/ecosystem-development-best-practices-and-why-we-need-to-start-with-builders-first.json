  "title": "Ecosystem Development Best Practices, and why we need to start with builders first",
  "description": "Given the myriad of chains out there, it is increasingly crucial for L2s to solidify their ecosystem building playbook and constantly refine it to win over (and more importantly, retain) users and builders. As an ecosystem builder in SEA (Thailand) who has worked with over 10 ecosystems including other L1s, on local, regional and global initiatives, I am excited to share the ins and outs of ecosystem building from a neutral perspective.",
