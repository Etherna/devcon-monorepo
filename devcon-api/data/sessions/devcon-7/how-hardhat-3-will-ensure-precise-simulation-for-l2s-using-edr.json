  "title": "How Hardhat 3 will ensure precise simulation for L2s using EDR",
  "description": "As the Ethereum ecosystem shifts towards L2 solutions, developers encounter new challenges in maintaining consistency and efficiency across different chains.\r\n\r\nHardhat is powered by EDR, a reusable Ethereum Development Runtime implementation to build developer tools. This talk will show how EDR's support for L2s in Hardhat 3 will streamline the development process, improve testing accuracy, and enhance the overall developer experience.",
