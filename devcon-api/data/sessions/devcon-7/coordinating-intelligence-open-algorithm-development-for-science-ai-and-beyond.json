  "description": "The Innovation Game (TIG) is a market-based framework accelerating development of computational methods crucial to science, engineering, and AI. It creates a \"synthetic market\" where \"Innovators\" contribute methods and are rewarded based on adoption by \"Benchmarkers,\" who are rewarded for solving random instances of computational challenges. This enables price discovery for commercial and pre-commercial research, attracting private investment. TIG's hybrid licensing model ensures open collaborat",
