  "title": "Changes to the L1 EVM versus L2s",
  "description": "The EVM has long been a target for improvement, but major changes have been postponed due to other priorities. As Ethereum's core, EVM modifications could significantly affect network stability, security, and performance, or add complexity. This necessitates lengthy approval and implementation processes. Panelists will explore new initiatives to implement EVM upgrades such as the EOF on L2s before L1, discussing their pros and cons.",
