  "title": "Non-Native Arithmetic via CRT Codes",
  "description": "Non-native arithmetic is an important and costly operation in SNARKs. It is essential for proving validity of general cryptographic data like RSA signatures, non-native elliptic curve arithmetic like secp256r1, and general SNARK proof composition. We investigate a new approach to prove non-native integer arithmetic using Residue Number Systems and a batch proximity test for Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) codes, as well as surprising connections to STARK soundness.",
