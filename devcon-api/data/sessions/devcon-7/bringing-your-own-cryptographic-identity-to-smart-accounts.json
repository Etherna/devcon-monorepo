  "description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is the backbone behind some of the most important components behind Account Abstraction. In our efforts for improving the account development experience and amplifying the design space, we're proposing a standard EIP for representing real-world cryptographic identities using ERC-1271 in a way that is compliant with ERC-4337 and ERC-7562 validation rules for storage access.",
