  "description": "One of the challenges for any L2 is to reflect accurately the cost for each opcode in zk-resources.\r\nEthereum L1 reflects the resource cost in term of GAS but lately it has been proposed chnages in opcode GAS cost to fit the zk-world to make Ethreum L1 more aligned to L2 or even with enshrined zk-rollups.\r\nIn this talk, I will explain the worst performance opcodes when comparing its GAS cost Vs zk-resources cost in Polygon zkEVM in typical transactions (erc20 trannsfers, swaps, ...)",
