  "description": "Ethereum made a significant contribution to the Cypherpunk agenda by removing central points of trust, allowing us to gain accountability, yet losing us any semblance of privacy that we had. There is hope at hand for privacy, but hope, in this case, is rather technical.\r\nThis talk aims to bring you up to scratch on privacy preserving tools while discussing S{N,T}ARKS, TEEs, FHE, how MPC elevates them in a decentralized setting, and highlighting their use from Auctions to ZK, from the 90s til now.",
