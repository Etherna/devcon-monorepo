  "title": "Memecraft: Effectively Communicating Crypto Concepts",
  "description": "Memes have been crucial to the proliferation of various concepts and ideas within the crypto space (ultrasound money, (3,3), regen/degen, QF) which has led to real capital being allocated toward impactful outcomes. The downside to some of this memeing however has been misleading narratives and misunderstandings. How do we leverage memetic power for education and tacit understanding of complex concepts?\r\n\r\nThe workshop will include 1) Scene Setting 2) Structured Discussion and a 3) Group Activity.",
