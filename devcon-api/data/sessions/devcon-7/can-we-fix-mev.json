  "description": "MEV is problematic today. The MEV supply chain puts centralizing pressure on Ethereum. There is also an Allocation Problem: proposers (not apps or users) earn nearly all MEV, though they are merely protocol agents. Numerous solutions address this (e.g., ePBS, EAs, ETs, FOCIL, BRAID), each with trade-offs and assumptions about whether MEV is intrinsic to blockchains or extrinsic and preventable. Research is challenging to enter w/o continuous engagement. I'll provide an overview of the research.",
