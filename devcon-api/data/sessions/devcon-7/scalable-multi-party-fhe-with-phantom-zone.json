  "title": "Scalable multi-party FHE with Phantom-zone",
  "description": "The talk introduces \"phantom-zone\", a framework to write scalable consumer facing MPC apps using multi-party FHE. Starting with what's multi-party FHE, talk gives a demo of non-trivial MPC app. Followed by introduction to programming model of MPC apps using multi-party FHE inside phantom-zone. Then the talk dives deep into primitives to realise multi-party FHE and ends with advanced FHE gadgets that further enhance multi-party FHE.",
