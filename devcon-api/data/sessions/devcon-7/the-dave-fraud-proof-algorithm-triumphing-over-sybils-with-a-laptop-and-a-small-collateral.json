  "title": "The Dave fraud-proof algorithm â€” triumphing over Sybils with a laptop and a small collateral",
  "description": "Current fraud-proof algorithms are susceptible to Sybil attacks, impacting safety, decentralization, and (settlement) liveness. This presentation introduces _Dave_, a novel algorithm that offers an unprecedented combination of these three properties. We demonstrate that there's no realistic Sybil attack capable of exhausting defenders' resources or causing significant delays, even with minimal stake requirements.",
