  "description": "In my EPF project, I implemented Ethshadow, a configuration generator for simulating Ethereum networks using Shadow, and used it to research improvements to the current state of PeerDAS and to estimate the effects of IDONTWANT on node bandwidth. In this presentation, I will present my findings and make a case for testing using Ethshadow.",
