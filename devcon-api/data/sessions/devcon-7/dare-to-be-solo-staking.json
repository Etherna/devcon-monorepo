  "title": "Dare to be Solo Staking",
  "description": "I have been solo staking on my home computer since the very first day of the beacon chain. It's been a challenging journey, and I anticipate it will remain so in the coming years. This talk will delve into the time, financial, and technical commitments required for solo staking. It aims to provide a practical overview of the solo staker experience from an Ethereum enthusiast's perspective. I will highlight what is keeping us from a wider solo staking community.",
