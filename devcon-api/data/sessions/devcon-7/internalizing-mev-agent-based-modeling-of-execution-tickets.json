  "title": "Internalizing MEV: Agent-based modeling of Execution Tickets",
  "description": "Execution Tickets are currently debated as one of the most promising approaches to solve MEV at protocol level. We created a holistic overview of different potential mechanism designs by doing a literature review, evaluating historical MEV data and implementing an agent-based model to realistically compare different mechanism designs and identify potential drawbacks early on. The agent-based modeling approach is presented together with the results.",
