  "description": "The removal of log events has sparked a discussion about its implications for apps that rely on events to display information. Without logs, developers would need to use specialized software to index the chain and search for specific actions, which is costly, not friendly with privacy and requires a case-by-case approach. This is in contrast to the current system, where logs provide developers with the freedom to query the chain anonymously, without limits, and without sacrificing any detail.",
