  "title": "Building an End-to-End ZK identity application",
  "description": "This workshop will walk you through an end to end application that demonstrates how to turn different sources of identity data (e.g. driverâ€™s license, paystubs, and etc) into verifiable format, and generate ZK proofs about that data (e.g. to apply for a loan) without building your own ZK circuits. The application is built with POD (Provable Object Data) and GPCs (General Purpose Circuits), which are also used by projects such as Zupass for your Devcon tickets.",
