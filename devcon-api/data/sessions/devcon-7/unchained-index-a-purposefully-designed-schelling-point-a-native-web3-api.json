  "title": "Unchained Index: A Purposefully Designed Schelling Point: A native Web3 API",
  "description": "The Unchained Index smart contract, part of TrueBlocks, acts as a purposefully-designed Schelling Point, creating a decentralized, permissionless store for blockchain index data. In this talk, we generalize the Unchained Index to show it can serve as a repository for other datasets such as event signatures and address labels. We contend we can replace costly APIs with a robust, reproducible public good, enhancing data accessibility & decentralization.",
