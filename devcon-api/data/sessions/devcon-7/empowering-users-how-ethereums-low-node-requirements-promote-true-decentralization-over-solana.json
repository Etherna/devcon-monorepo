  "title": "Empowering Users: How Ethereumâ€™s Low Node Requirements Promote True Decentralization Over Solana",
  "description": "Nine years after Ethereum's launch, you can still run a node at home on commodity hardware, even low-powered devices like $185 ARM64 boards.\r\n\r\nWhy is this so important? Wouldn't Solana's approach, using more powerful hardware for higher speed and throughput, be better? We'll explore why home nodes matter for decentralization, credible neutrality, and global accessibility.\r\n\r\nWe'll also compare node requirements vs the Nakamoto coefficient as metrics for measuring decentralization.",
