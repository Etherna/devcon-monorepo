  "description": "This talk presents an empirical analysis of CEX-DEX-Perpetual arbitrage on Layer 2 chains (FCFS vs. PGA chains), examining transaction data, market structure, and profitability patterns. It compares realised and theoretical Loss versus Rebalancing (LVR); then further reveals whether specific designs of the chain such as block time, permissionless sequencer, public/private mempool lead to better or worse LVR. Finally it proposes/calls out solutions for LVR reduction protocol designs for L2.",
