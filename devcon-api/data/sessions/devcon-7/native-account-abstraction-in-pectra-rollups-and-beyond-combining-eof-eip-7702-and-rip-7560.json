  "description": "Account Abstraction has rightfully become one of the most discussed topics in the Ethereum ecosystem.\r\nThe upcoming Pectra upgrade is set to be the first one to improve EOAs by including EIP-7702.\r\nBut can EIP-7702 alone achieve \"Account Abstraction\"?\r\n\r\nWe will discuss the challenges and benefits of EIP-7702, and break down the team's vision for achieving \"complete\" Native Account Abstraction with RIP-7560/EIP-7701 and how it differs from ERC-4337 + EIP-7702.",
