  "title": "Reclaiming our $8 billion: funding public goods with stablecoin profits",
  "description": "Ethereum is stuck in a dark deal with two companies. They control ~all stablecoins; facilitate 49% of DEX swaps; and can overrule all future hardforks:\r\n\r\nCircle & Tether.\r\n\r\nIn return, they reap $7.4B in stablecoin earnings (2023).\r\n\r\nBut wait—that’s the interest on OUR money! We should be in control.\r\n\r\nGiving to holders is illegal, but funding public goods isn’t.\r\n\r\nIf we coordinate, we can switch to nonprofit stablecoins and reclaim billions for eg Protocol Guild, R&D, DeFi infra, OSS—or other causes.",
