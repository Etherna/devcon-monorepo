  "description": "In may 2024 I found multiple bugs in lending market which allowed to steal $1.1 mln. The exploit itself was very complicated and required multiple steps, including exploitation of liquidation process of unhealthy loan which worked very similar to flash loan. \r\nI'll tell the story of how I decided to check this project source code to finding an issue, contacting with owners of platform and fixing it. I'll also share the best tips how to avoid and prevent such issues in other projects.",
