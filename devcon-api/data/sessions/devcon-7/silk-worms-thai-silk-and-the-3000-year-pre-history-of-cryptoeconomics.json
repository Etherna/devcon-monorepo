  "title": "Silk worms, thai silk, and the 3,000-year pre-history of cryptoeconomics",
  "description": "Some of the oldest preserved fibers of silk on earth are those at Ban Chiang, in the North of Thailand.\r\n\r\nToday the phrase \"silk road\" is used to describe not only the history of Eurasian trade, but also colloquially any social situation in which secret or taboo commerce flourishes.\r\n\r\nThis talk explores the impact of the silk worm in driving stateless commerce, and identifies history practices arising from the silk routes which are now enshrined in cryptoeconomics.",
