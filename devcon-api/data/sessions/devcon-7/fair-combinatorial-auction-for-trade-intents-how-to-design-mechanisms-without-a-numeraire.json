  "title": "Fair combinatorial auction for trade intents: how to design mechanisms without a numeraire",
  "description": "When designing mechanisms on the blockchain, there may be no single asset that can be used to reallocate the benefits of participating in the mechanism among its participants. Hence, the designer cannot separately address achieving an objective and sharing the resulting gains, as the objective affects how/whether these gains can be shared. This raises fairness concerns. We discuss the relevance of this issue for trade intent auctions and propose a novel mechanism: the fair combinatorial auction.",
