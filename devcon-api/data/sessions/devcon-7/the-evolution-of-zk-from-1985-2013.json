  "title": "The Evolution of ZK from 1985-2013",
  "description": "This session delves into the rich history of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), tracing key milestones from their inception in 1985 to groundbreaking advancements like simulation extractability and the first non-interactive zero-knowledge protocol (NIZK), the first SNARK protocol, etc. While many advances happened within the crypto space, it is beneficial to be aware about the evolution of ZK prior to us inheriting it from the theoretical world.",
