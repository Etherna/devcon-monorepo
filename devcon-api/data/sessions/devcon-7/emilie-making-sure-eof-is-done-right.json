  "title": "Emilie - Making sure EOF is done right",
  "description": "We present Emilie. Emilie is designed to ensure the correct implementation of the EVM Object Format (EOF) by testing compilers and execution clients. It re-executes mainnet transactions using EOF bytecode instead of original bytecode, comparing results and performance with the original execution.\r\nEmilie tests interactions between EOF and legacy contracts using real data. It supports recompilation for Solidity and Vyper, enabling it to find bugs across compilers and execution clients.",
