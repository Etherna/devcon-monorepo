  "transcript_text": " . Unmute. There we go. Hello, everyone. I'm sorry I couldn't make it today, but it seems like everyone's having a great time in Thailand. A bit of introduction to myself, I'm Emmanuel Mostak, previously a CEO founder of Stability AI, where we had about 300 million downloads of our open source models from stable video, stable audio, but most famously stable diffusion, the most popular image model in the world. At one point we were running about 10,000 A100s, which is one of the top 10 supercomputers, and it was quite a ride and interesting. But the original intention of Stability 10 supercomputers, and it was quite a ride and interesting. But the original intention of stability was to be decentralized. It was originally meant to be a DAO of DAOs. And earlier this year, I had a big think about that and the future of AI and where we're going. So in this talk today, I'm going to touch on a few elements of that and try to frame it and how we can impact that. Now with my new organization, Shelling, we've kind of honed down to, we're moving to a post-labor economy. So let's try and build AI money to stack GPUs and increase the intelligence by building open source models and supporting others. So the demand side of Deepin, but that's a story for another day, perhaps. I think that there are three types of AI model, and this is where it becomes very interesting. The one that's been most famous has been these private models, these chat GPTs and anthropic cords and others. These are like expert systems trying to achieve AGI, kind of do everything. And the knowledge that they have and the data sets they have are private. That's interesting, but I think it's that exciting, honestly. In the middle, we have a different type of knowledge, which is public knowledge that is licensed. So that's entertainment, innovation, licensed data and weights. And I put Mattel's Lama model under this, you know, open weights, but you don't know what's inside it. On the left-hand side, I think is the most interesting, which is common knowledge. And we recently wrote a piece, How to Think About AI, where we're like, models are like graduates. And, you know, they're going to come out as doctors, lawyers, et cetera. Every industry that's regulated is likely to require open source and open data models. And the stuff that's regulated is the stuff that we need for living, which I think is the most interesting part. There was a very interesting paper by Anthropic at the start of the year called Sleeper Agents, where they showed why it's important to know the data that goes in, as in what are the ingredients, how the sausage is made. With just a few thousand words and trillions of words of data going into models, you can make it so it turns provably evil with a single indicator. And you can't tune that out and you can't identify it beforehand. So I think rather than having black boxes, the models that we have to run our lives will be open source, open data. The question is who will build those and who will coordinate those? Because the reality is models are reaching.",
