  "title": "A Deep Dive into General Purpose Circuits",
  "description": "This workshop will explore the usage and inner workings of General Purpose Circuits (GPCs), a family of ZK-circuits for proving about Provable Object Data (PODs). PODs, used by projects such as Zupass, are cryptographically-signed key-value stores that allow developers and users to seamlessly make cryptographic guarantees about data, some typical use-cases being ticket issuance and proofs of attendance. GPCs enable us to make ZK proofs about PODs without the complexity of manual circuit writing.",
