  "description": "We will introduce the Anon-Aadhaar protocol which is an anonymity layer on top of a social security like Scheme (Aadhaar card) for Indian citizens using Zero-knowledge proofs. This can be used for getting many basic services in India like electricity, banking, etc. We will describe the implementation results of the protocol using Halo2. We will also provide a comparative analysis of benchmarks using different backends like Circom, Halo2 and possibly Noir.",
