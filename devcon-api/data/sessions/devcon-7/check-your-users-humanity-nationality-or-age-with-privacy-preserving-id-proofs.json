  "description": "This workshop shows how to use the Proof of Passport SDK to check user's identity in a few lines of code. Let users generate zk proofs of age, nationality, humanity or non-inclusion in the OFAC list by scanning the NFC chip in their passport or ID card, and without ever having to reveal any private information.\r\n\r\nCome try it now!",
