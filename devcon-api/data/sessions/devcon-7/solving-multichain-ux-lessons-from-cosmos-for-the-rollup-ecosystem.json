  "title": "Solving Multichain UX: Lessons from Cosmos for the Rollup Ecosystem",
  "description": "This talk addresses how we tackled challenges in the Cosmos ecosystem like liquidity fragmentation, multi-chain accounts, and cross-chain contract standards, and how these solutions can be used to improve cross-chain UX in the rollup ecosystem. \r\n\r\nIf time allows, we'll also dig into designing flexible and scalable abstractions for rapid deployment of integrations (bridges, dexs, wallets) across not just many chains, but many diverse tech stacks.",
