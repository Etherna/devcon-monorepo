  "title": "Financial Nihilism vs FOSS Culture: The Battle for Ethereum’s Soul",
  "description": "In recent years, the Ethereum ecosystem has witnessed a stark dichotomy: the rise of financial nihilism through memecoins and rampant speculation on one side, and the foundational principles of the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) community, emphasising public goods, interdependence, and intrinsic rewards, on the other. \r\n\r\nThis talk will delve into the experiences of interacting with FOSS developers, shedding light on their views and concerns regarding Ethereum’s current trajectory.",
