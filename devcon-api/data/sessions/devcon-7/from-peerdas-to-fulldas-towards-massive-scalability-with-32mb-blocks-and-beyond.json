  "title": "From PeerDAS to FullDAS: towards massive scalability with 32MB blocks and beyond",
  "description": "PeerDAS is expected to be one of the most interesting improvements of the Pectra hard fork, enabling long-awaited sharding on Ethereum, unleashing L2 scaling.\r\n\r\nPeerDAS is however just the start with up to 1-2 MB of blob space per slot. We look into the techniques jointly developed by our Codex Research Team and EF researchers to improve this by orders of magnitude, targeting 32 MB (and beyond) of data availability space.",
