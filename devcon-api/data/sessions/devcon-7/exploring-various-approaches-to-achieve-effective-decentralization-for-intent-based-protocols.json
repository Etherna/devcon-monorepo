  "title": "Exploring various approaches to achieve effective decentralization for Intent-Based protocols",
  "description": "Intents are emerging as the gold standard for transacting on-chain. However, they do come with decentralization trade-offs. In this talk, I'd like to present the status quo, various architectures, and new tradeoffs in terms of where they fit in the trilemma of fees, execution speed, and execution guarantees. The objective is to achieve maximum decentralization while maintaining a great UX and efficiency.",
