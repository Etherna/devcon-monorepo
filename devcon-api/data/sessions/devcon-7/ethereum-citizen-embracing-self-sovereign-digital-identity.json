  "title": "Ethereum Citizen: Embracing Self-Sovereign Digital Identity",
  "description": "The world is changing. Everything is becoming digital. As we seek to extract more from digital services, we are giving them more and more of our personal data.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't have to be this way. Just as we gained self-sovereignty and ownership over our digital assets and money, we can achieve the same for our digital identities and data using similar and new technologies.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will explain what self-sovereign identity is, why we need it, and where we stand today.",
