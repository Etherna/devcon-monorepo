  "title": "Redefining DAOs: State of DAOs in Asia",
  "description": "We are a team from Metagov and DAOstar, advancing the global DAO movement through standards like ERC-4824 and exploring diverse DAO narratives worldwide. We've commissioned multiple reports on the “State of DAOs” in Asia, covering Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Greater China, and SEA. Our panel will discuss these findings, focusing on DAO narratives, regulations, opportunities, and differences between Eastern and Western DAOs, aiming to bridge the gap in the global DAO discourse.",
