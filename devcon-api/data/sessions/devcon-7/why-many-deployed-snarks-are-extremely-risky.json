  "title": "Why many deployed SNARKs are extremely risky",
  "description": "We analyze the real-world security of FRI, a key component in many SNARKs securing billions in blockchain transactions. We discover alarming gaps between conjectured and provable security in deployed FRI parameters. Most cases show 21-63 bits weaker provable security than conjectured. This leaves systems vulnerable if better attacks emerge. We propose guidelines for achieving 100 bits of provable security and a method for parameter tuning, aiming to enhance SNARK security in L2s+blockchains.",
