  "description": "Recently, at PSE, we have been exploring the field of cryptography, specifically focusing on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). FHE enables secure interactions with encrypted data between different parties.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will introduce key concepts and essential information tailored for developers and application designers. This will help them quickly grasp the fundamentals without getting bogged down by complex mathematical details.",
