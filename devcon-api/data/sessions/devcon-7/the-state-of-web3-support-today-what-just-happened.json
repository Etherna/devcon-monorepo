  "description": "One of the most common and painful experiences someone can have today is also one of the most fundamental concepts we tend to take for granted - transactions. Users who seek support for their issues lack the appropriate level of information to even understand what they were doing when it all went wrong. This talk will examine why core web3 experiences are still problematic and propose things to consider when building experiences for everyone that ranges from in app UX to community support tools.",
