  "description": "The rollup-centric roadmap is critical for scaling Ethereum but has introduced fragmentation of users, developers, and liquidity. But don't worry, based rollups are here to save the day! But wtf is a “based rollup”? And wtf are these “pre-confs” that usually get talked about together?\r\n\r\nThe focus of this talk is to demystify these concepts and try and get more people engaged in the based rollup ecosystem, which has the potential to heal Ethereum’s fragmentation problem.",
