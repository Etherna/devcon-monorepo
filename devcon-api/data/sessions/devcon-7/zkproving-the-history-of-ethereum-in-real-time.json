  "description": "I'll explain the current work that we are doing in the Polygon zk teams to improve the performance of the provers and the quality of the tooling.\r\nI'll will explain how we can parallelise the generation of the proof and how we can integrate with different hardware and software so that it should allow to build a zk proof of a block in real time. \r\nI'll explain also how this proofs can be recursively linked to build a zkProof that can proof the whole Ethereum history from the genesis.",
