  "description": "We will go over the implementation and research status of ePBS (EIP-7732) and the future iterations and mechanisms it enables.We will describe in detail the main benefits to the protocol that are not directly related to any PBS system. We will showcase the tradeoffs that are present on each design decision and how the separation of validation between the consensus and execution layer in fact frees research with less technical debt and more independent mechanisms for future upgrades.",
