  "title": "Verifiable Open Source Vaccines to Save Millions of Lives from the Developing World Up",
  "description": "Viruses & bacteria like HCV, Strep A, and TB cumulatively take millions of lives each year – effective vaccines against them would considerably reduce that death toll. Unfortunately, big pharma isn’t interested in investing in developing these vaccines, and even if they did exist, rising vaccine hesitancy may prevent many from benefitting. PopVax is pioneering a new model of developing first-in-the-world verifiable vaccines at dramatically lower cost in India with radically greater transparency.",
