  "title": "Circle STARK GPU Acceleration: An Analysis of Performance and Implementation",
  "description": "The session will cover the overview of GPU acceleration for ZK-SNARK/STARK proof systems, focusing on the GPU implementation of Circle STARK. It will address challenges and solutions in implementation, delving into parallelizing computations in provers. We'll compare CPU and GPU performance. Finally, we'll explore future directions for hardware acceleration (ie. FPGA).",
