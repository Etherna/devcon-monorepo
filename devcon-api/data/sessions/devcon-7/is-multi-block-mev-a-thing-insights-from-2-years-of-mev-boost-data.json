  "title": "Is multi-block MEV a thing? Insights from 2 years of MEV Boost Data",
  "description": "Multi-block MEV describes MEV that arises from one party controlling several consecutive slots. Currently, it is discussed as a potential blocker for several prominent mechanism designs. We analyzed two years of MEV boost data covering more than 5 million slots to investigate historical patterns of it. Amongst other findings we see less multi-slot sequences occur than randomly feasible however that payments for longer sequences are higher than average.",
