  "description": "A direct consequence of centralized block production is a deterioration of Ethereum's censorship resistance properties. In this talk, we introduce FOCIL, a simple committee-based design improving upon previous inclusion list and co-created block mechanisms. We present the benefits of (1) relying on a committee to address issues related to bribing/extortion attacks, and (2) having attesters enforce the IL as part of the block validity condition to prevent IL equivocation.",
