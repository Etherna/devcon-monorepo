  "title": "Double entry point issues - From breaking Compound to Uniswap v4",
  "description": "A short explanation of a critical-severity vulnerability we found in the Uniswap V4 core contracts that would have caused a ~$15M loss in Uniswap's pools. The goal is to explain the risks of double entry points, from the $30M+ TUSD issue in Compound to the Uniswap V4-specific case where protocols use native tokens and operate on chains where the native token has a corresponding ERC-20 token, and how to prevent them.",
