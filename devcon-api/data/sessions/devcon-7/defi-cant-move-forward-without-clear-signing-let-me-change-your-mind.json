  "title": "DeFi Can’t Move Forward Without Clear Signing: Let Me Change Your Mind",
  "description": "Blind signing has been the default way of signing transactions in DeFi, but let’s be honest: as an industry we are shooting ourselves and our users in the foot by continuing to throw caution to the wind. \r\n\r\nWe want to make it easy to implement clear signing for every dAapp, minimizing the work required for developers to make the ecosystem more approachable and secure.\r\n\r\nBlind signing is an existential threat to what we do, it’s time to change it, and we need your help.",
