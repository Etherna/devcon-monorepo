  "title": "Unlocking New Possibilities with Stateless Architecture in Layer 2",
  "description": "Explore the potential of stateless architecture in Layer 2 solutions. As Layer 2 technologies evolve, we will discuss the fundamental trade-offs and present how combining client-side Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) with stateless architecture enhances efficiency. This session will highlight innovative possibilities not yet widely discussed in the Ethereum community, showing how this approach can revolutionize scalability, security, and privacy.",
