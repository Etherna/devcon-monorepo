  "title": "Ethereum's Values and Ethos Alignment: Pre-Merge to Now",
  "description": "If you ask Ethereans to describe \"What is Ethereum?\" in 1 sentence, what would it be? Likely, you will get many different answers depending on who you're speaking to. Some visions have changed over time and some stayed true to the cypherpunk values such as decentralization, trustlessness & censorship-resistance. Or is it more important for us to focus on DA & scalability at L1? What should L1 actually be responsible for? Is local block building dead? Are timing games bad? What do we value today?",
