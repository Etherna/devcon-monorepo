  "description": "Nick Johnson, founder of ENS, gives an update on the state of ENS, and our progress with migrating over to layer 2. ENS's approach to layer 2 aims to preserve users' ability to choose where their names are stored and administered, while massively reducing transaction costs and increasing scalability for the vast majority of users. Embracing its status as a public good, we want to make ENS the most useful to the largest number of people possible.",
