  "description": "Development nodes, such as Anvil, Hardhat, and Tenderly, provide specialized methods to manipulate blockchain state. For example, the `anvil_setCode` method allows arbitrary overriding smart contract code. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, each node implements a slightly different set of methods with varying behaviours, resulting in wasted development hours and potential vendor lock-in.\r\n\r\nIn my talk, I introduce a new EIP that proposes standardized `cheat_*` methods with well-defined interfaces and behaviour.",
