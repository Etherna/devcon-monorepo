  "description": "Underlying the FROGCRYPTO activations throughout the Devcon week are different programmable cryptography primitives. For instance, the frogs collected via Zupass differ significantly from those that interact in Frogzone. At the Frogrammable Cryptography CLS, we will break down these different primitives through technical talks, lightning sessions, and hands-on workshops, while also offering a glimpse of what is coming next.",
