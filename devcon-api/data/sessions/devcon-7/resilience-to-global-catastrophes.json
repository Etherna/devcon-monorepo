  "description": "The risk of nuclear war or an extreme pandemic is frighteningly high. Little work has been done on resilience to these catastrophes. I’ll discuss resilient food sources that can be scaled up quickly, methods of maintaining the functioning of critical sectors in an extreme pandemic, and backup methods of meeting basic needs. I’ll discuss cost effectiveness of low-cost preparations, including piloting technologies, such as resilient satellite communications, and a resilience DAO.",
