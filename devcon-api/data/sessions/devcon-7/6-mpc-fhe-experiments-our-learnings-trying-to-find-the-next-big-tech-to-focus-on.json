  "title": "6 MPC-FHE experiments. Our learnings trying to find the next big tech to focus on.",
  "description": "This talk mainly focuses on showcasing the work that some PSE members did while starting to dive into MPC-FHE during Q2 2024. This work is composed by various explorations within the MPC-FHE realm that move towards different directions and goals.\r\n\r\nFrom FHE compilers to FFT Bootstrapping GPU optimization proposals, passing by FHE Game demos and many application level implementations, the talk aims to reach beginner-advanced audience on the research/product paths that we have explored so far.",
