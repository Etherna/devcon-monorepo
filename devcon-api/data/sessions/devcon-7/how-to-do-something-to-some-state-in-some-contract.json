  "description": "Smart contracts are changing. \r\n\r\nSo far, they needed every transaction to be public in order for nodes to agree. Zero-Knowledge came in to change things a bit: you can actually make your transaction client-side and just broadcast a proof.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we will use Noir and write a simple Aztec and/or Ethereum contract that allows for most of the execution and state to remain private.",
