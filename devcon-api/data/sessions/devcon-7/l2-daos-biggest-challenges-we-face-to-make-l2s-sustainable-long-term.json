  "title": "L2 DAOs - biggest challenges we face to make L2s sustainable long term",
  "description": "Today L2 DAOs are mostly focused on growth and supporting their ecosystem builders. But long-term they will be responsible for the management and maintenance of their chains from all perspectives - ecosystem growth, software development, security, chain economic parameters management, and others. In this talk, I will explore what DAOs need to figure out and fix before they will be able to take this responsibility in the coming years and why we should be addressing those issues already today.",
