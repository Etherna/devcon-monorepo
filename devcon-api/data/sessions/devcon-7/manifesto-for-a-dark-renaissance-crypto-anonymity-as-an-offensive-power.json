  "title": "Manifesto for a Dark Renaissance: Crypto-Anonymity as an Offensive Power",
  "description": "Crypto will split in two. Regfi is the above ground regulated side of crypto, locked down and never challenging power. Darkfi is the generative side of crypto where new ground is explored.\r\n\r\nRegfi is an example of a fragile narrative. When governments crack down, institutional capital gets scared exiting the system causing price dumps. Whereas in an adversarial environment, darkfi thrives- its thesis validated triggering an arms race with governments.",
