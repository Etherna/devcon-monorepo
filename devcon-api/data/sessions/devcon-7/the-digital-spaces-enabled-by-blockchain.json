  "description": "Blockchains made it possible to have digital spaces analog with physical spaces that can be public and intersubjective. It happened just as we became more and more reliant on digital spaces.\r\n\r\nSo how do we create inhabitable digital spaces instead of renting in the feudal system of corporates? This talk will answer it by weaving together lessons learned from decentralized social networks and ideas from thinkers such as Christopher Alexander, Stewart Brand, and James Scott.",
