  "description": "We will focus on conditional markets and futures, where participants can bet on how outcomes (stock prices, inflation rates, commodities futures) are expected to vary depending on particular conditions (who wins an election, interest rate changes, etc).\r\n\r\nGoing more deeply, we discuss how conditional markets can be used to make decisions, in what is called decision markets or futarchy, how this can improve the governance of autonomous organizations and allow credibly-neutral public goods funding.",
