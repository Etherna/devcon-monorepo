  "title": "Anti-Correlation Penalties for Better Decentralization",
  "description": "Anti-Correlation Penalties is a proposal to allow the penalties for missed attestations to vary over slots, based on the number of missed attestations in the respective slots. This is great for non-correlated parties such as solo stakers and improves decentralization, fault tolerance and diversity in the validator set.",
