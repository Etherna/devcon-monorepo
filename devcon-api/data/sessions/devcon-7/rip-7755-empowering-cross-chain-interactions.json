  "title": "RIP-7755: Empowering Cross-Chain Interactions",
  "description": "Cross-chain interactions are becoming essential as Ethereum Layer 2 solutions multiply. RIP-7755 changes the game by trustlessly bridging the gap between L2 chains, allowing new use cases that rely solely on Ethereum and its rollups. In this workshop, weâ€™ll explore RIP-7755 by building a cross-chain NFT minting app, focusing on nested storage proof implementation details to eliminate trust assumptions.",
