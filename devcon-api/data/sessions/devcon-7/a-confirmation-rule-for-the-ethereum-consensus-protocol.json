  "description": "In this talk, we present an algorithm that, assuming good network conditions, reliably determines in less than a minute whether a proposed block will always be part of the canonical chain.\r\nThis represents a considerable speedup compared to waiting for the full security guarantees provided by block finalization, which takes 13 minutes in the best-case scenario.\r\nAlso, as we will explain, this is algorithm is a far better metric than using chain depth like some services still do.",
