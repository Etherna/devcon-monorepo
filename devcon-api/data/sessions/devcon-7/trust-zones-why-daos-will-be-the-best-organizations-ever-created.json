  "title": "Trust Zones: Why DAOs will be the best organizations ever created",
  "description": "This talk introduces the theory of Trust Zones. Every Trust Zone is a unique blend of constraints,  reputation requirements, and accountability measures, within which an agent can operate on behalf of an organization to further its goals.\r\n\r\nI will contend that the operational management of all organizations can be described as creating new Trust Zones and adjusting their parameters. And further, that DAOs and other onchain organizations can do this better than any other organizational form.",
