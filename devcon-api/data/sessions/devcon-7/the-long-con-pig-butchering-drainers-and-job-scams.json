  "title": "The Long Con: Pig Butchering, Drainers, and Job Scams",
  "description": "I'll discuss the different types of malicious actors from low-skilled script kiddies to government-sanctioned advanced persistent threats. This presentation will include an overview on drainer groups and how sophisticated scammers string along their victims, fattening them up before extracting as much value as they can, as well as the nefarious practices these operations employ. Finally, I'll focus on the recent rise of job scams that have been targeting builders and employers alike.",
