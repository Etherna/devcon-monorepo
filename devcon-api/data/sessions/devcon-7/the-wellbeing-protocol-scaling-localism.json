  "title": "The Wellbeing Protocol - Scaling Localism",
  "description": "The Wellbeing Protocol began as a New Zealand Government-funded project to explore how Web 3 / DAO inspired governance patterns and localism could transform the community grant funding system. After successful trials in New Zealand, Australia and the UK, a TVNZ documentary, and international media coverage we are keen to share the challenges and learnings on our journey towards creating hyperlocal DAOs for marginalised / disempowered communities.",
