  "title": "The Wellbeing Protocol - Scaling Localism",
  "description": "The Wellbeing Protocol, a not-for-profit initiative, began as a New Zealand Government-funded project to explore how Web 3 / DAO inspired governance patterns and localism could transform the community grant funding system. After successful trials in New Zealand and the UK, a TVNZ documentary, international coverage and being accepted into the SOCAP fellowship program we are keen to share our learnings with the broader community that values localism and community empowerment.",
