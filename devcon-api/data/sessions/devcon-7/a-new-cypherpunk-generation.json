  "description": "This talk is giving an insight into the current hacking/cracking/pirating culture that is thriving on the internet. A visibility inside the actual (gray&blackhat) environment where people are moving, and what do they do to \"make\" a living. \r\n\r\nShowcasing active forums such as breachforum, telegram groups, services they provide alongside explanations on what they do and how they do. \r\n\r\nWhat can we learn from them? And how can make sure that we do not become the goliath we all hate,",
