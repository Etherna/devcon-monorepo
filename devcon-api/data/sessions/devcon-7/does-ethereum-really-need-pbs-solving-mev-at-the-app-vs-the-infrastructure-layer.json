  "title": "Does Ethereum Really Need PBS? Solving MEV at the app vs the infrastructure layer",
  "description": "In this talk, we will give a brief history of MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) and its influence on enshrining PBS (Proposer Builder Separation) into Ethereum. We will explore the Ethereum communityâ€™s evolving perspectives on PBS while looking at successful outcomes, unexpected consequences, and alternate solutions. \r\n\r\nUltimately, the talk will provocatively ask: does Ethereum really need PBS at all?",
