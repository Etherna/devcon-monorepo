  "title": "Growing The Biomes GDP Using Digital Matter & Smart Items",
  "description": "Biomes is growing the virtual world with the largest GDP. As a fully onchain 3D voxel world, every single action in Biomes -- mining, building, crafting, even moving -- is a transaction on the Redstone L2. \r\n\r\nWe will share stories how we're working to grow the GDP of Biomes, what is working and what isn't. We will also share examples and ideas for onchain smart items in the Biomes world enabled by smart contracts.",
