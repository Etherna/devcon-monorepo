  "description": "Imagine all data was guaranteed to be correct. We could build a trustworthy digital world based only on correct data. In this presentation, we will sketch layers and techniques that can realize this dream, in particular proof carrying data and succinct proofs.  We will also discuss the connection to the proof singularity vision for Ethereum as well as highlight caveats that apply; humanity is still in the early stages of the journey and there are obstacles and constraints to tackle",
