  "title": "Beyond recursive proving for Starknet",
  "description": "Recursive proving is very cool tech enabling very large proofs or combining many different statements into a single proof. Beyond recursive proving, statements can be combined in interesting ways to further reduce system overheads such as data availability compression and layer1 state updates as well as various privacy concepts. In this session we'll discuss some of these technologies and how they are being applied in Starknet to achieve various user and system benefits.",
