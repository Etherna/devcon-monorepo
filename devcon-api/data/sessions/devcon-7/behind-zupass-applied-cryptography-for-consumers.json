  "title": "Behind Zupass: Applied Cryptography For Consumers",
  "description": "Recent advancements in cryptography on consumer devices (like your mobile phone) and progress in developer tooling (Semaphore, SnarkJS) have led to the emergence of open-source projects such as Zupass, a personal \"cryptographic computer\" helping power Devcon.\r\n\r\nThis talk dives into the technical challenges behind scaling ZKPs to 10,000+ consumer devices and the history behind the project, from its inception at Zuzalu to its usage at recent Ethereum events (Devconnect, ProgCrypto, ETHBerlin).",
