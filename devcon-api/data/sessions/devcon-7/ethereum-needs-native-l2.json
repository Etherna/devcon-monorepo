  "title": "Ethereum needs native L2",
  "description": "Right now, L2beat tracks 116 L2s. However, they represent a wide range of trust assumptions, which makes assets—or more abstractly, messages—from these L2s non-fungible and thus significantly hampers interoperability. We are advocating for Ethereum to deploy a large number of native L2s, developed and governed by Ethereum's open-source developers. These L2s would be highly interoperable with L1, fulfilling Ethereum's early promise to provide sharding using L2 technology.",
