  "description": "Sponsored by the Ethereum Foundation, our project evaluates the real cost of executing OPCODEs in EVMs across diverse clients. Following up on the successful session at Devconnect Istanbul, we present the up-to-date benchmarks, the new Gas Cost Schedule proposal, the do-it-yourself solution to repeat measurements in your environment and an automated proposal generator to be revised for each hard-fork.",
