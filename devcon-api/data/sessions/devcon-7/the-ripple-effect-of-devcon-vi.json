  "description": "Devcon VI in Bogotá accelerated community growth across the region. Local communities emerged in several cities in Colombia and Latin America. The gathering provided leaders with a new perspective on enhancing collective creation for social impact and blockchain adoption. At ETH Bogotá, we used this spark to transition from hosting general events to creating an educational system for developers and builders, aiming to push the adoption of blockchain and Ethereum in a new way.",
