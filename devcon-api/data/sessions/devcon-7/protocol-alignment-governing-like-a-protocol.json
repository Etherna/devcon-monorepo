  "description": "We define a protocol as *aligned* when **all stakeholders in its network agree**:\r\n1. The protocolâ€™s objectives\r\n2. How to measure progress toward objectives\r\n3. How to achieve the objectives\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore both new and old decentralized mechanisms that governance leads and protocol designers can leverage to address misalignment in governance.",
