  "title": "Based Preconfirmations with MR-MEV-Boost",
  "description": "In this talk, we will analyze a simple strawman setup of based preconfirmations to highlight its challenges, such as supply chain centralization, the lack of pricing mechanisms, and latency/spam races. We will then introduce MR-MEV-Boost, a preconfirmation solution that runs multiple rounds of MEV-Boost auctions within a single slot. This solution addresses the mentioned challenges by preconfirming batches instead of individual transactions and better integrating with the L1 PBS pipeline.",
