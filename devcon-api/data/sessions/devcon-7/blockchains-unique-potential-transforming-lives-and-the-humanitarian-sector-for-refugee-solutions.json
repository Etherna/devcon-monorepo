  "title": "Blockchain's Unique Potential: Transforming Lives & the Humanitarian Sector for Refugee Solutions",
  "description": "This talk covers blockchain pilot projects in Uganda and Thailand, demonstrating how technology transforms lives through local collaboration. The Uganda pilot uses public goods funding to fund a  refugee-led music production studio and produce music NFT's. The Thailand pilot utilizes crypto to send aid to Burmese refugees, and tests crypto->fiat off-ramps across the country. These initiatives highlight the effectiveness of hyper-local solutions and offer insights for future humanitarian efforts.",
