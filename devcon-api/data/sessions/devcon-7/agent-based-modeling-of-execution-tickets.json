  "description": "Execution Tickets are currently debated as one of the most promising approaches to streamline incentives at protocol level. We created a holistic overview of potential mechanism designs and implementing an agent-based model to realistically compare different mechanism designs and identify potential drawbacks early on. The agent-based modeling approach is presented together with the results. In the second part, we will guide through running the simulation in the workshop.",
