  "title": "How Ethereum Clients Efficiently Manage State Storage",
  "description": "In the execution and consensus layers of Ethereum, the ever growing state sizes are a major challenge for core developers. This talk aims to review how EL and CL clients are managing state storage in their implementations. Execution layer state and Consensus layer Beacon State are wildly different, but some storage techniques can be applied to each for a more efficient state storage design. Furthermore, this talk  touches on future research to improve state storage within the protocol.",
