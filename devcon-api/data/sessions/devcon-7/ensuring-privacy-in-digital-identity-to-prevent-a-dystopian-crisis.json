  "title": "Ensuring Privacy in Digital Identity to Prevent a Dystopian Crisis",
  "description": "This talk will explore introducing a method for privacy-preserving proof of user uniqueness in contexts like elections using DIDs, ZK, and VCs for verifying credentials without revealing unique identifiers while ensuring compatibility with multiple trust sources. This enables self-sovereign digital identity, allowing selective disclosure of verified credentials while protecting personal data, supporting privacy-preserving KYC, sybil resistance, compliant access to financial services, and more.",
