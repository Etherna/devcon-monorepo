  "title": "Beyond Ligero and Brakedown: Building a Fast Prover Based on List-Polynomial Commitments",
  "description": "Linear codes underlie one of the main approaches in zero-knowledge proofs and arguments, including works like FRI, Ligero, Brakedown and Orion. In this talk, we describe how to extend one of the protocols from Ligero and Brakedown to the regime of batched polynomial commitments, at the cost of a single extra operation in the verifier. Similarly to Redshift, we opt for increased efficiency via the list decoding regime. We also present an optimisation for using the resulting commitment with PIOPs.",
