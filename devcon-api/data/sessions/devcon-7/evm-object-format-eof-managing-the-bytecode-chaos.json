  "title": "EVM Object Format (EOF): Managing the Bytecode Chaos",
  "description": "Currently, EVM bytecode, while powerful and simple, lacks structure. This leads to many complexities when introducing new EIPs and maintaining backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we illustrate some use cases of the EVM Object Format (EOF). Next, we provide a quick overview of the main changes introduced by the EOF and related EIPs. Finally, we discuss security considerations that could arise with the introduction of EOF, including cross-EOF contract interactions and new instructions.",
