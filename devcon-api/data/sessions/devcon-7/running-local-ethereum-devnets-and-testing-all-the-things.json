  "title": "Running local Ethereum devnets and testing all the things",
  "description": "Interoperability testing with testnets has always been a critical part of testing the ethereum infrastructure. This workshop is intended to teach users how they can quickly set up their own devnets locally and run a suite of other software alongside them such as mev relays/builders, transaction spammers, etc. This talk/workshop will go from 0 devnet experience to running a local devnet with any multi-client combinations, various fuzzers, and simulated infrastructure chaos.",
