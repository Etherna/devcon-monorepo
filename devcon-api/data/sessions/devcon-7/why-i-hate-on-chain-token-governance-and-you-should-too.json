  "title": "Why I Hate On Chain Token Governance & You Should Too ðŸ˜º",
  "description": "Ethereum heavily utilizes it's strong social layer for protocol governance decisions. In recent years, we have seen projects try on chain token holder governance to make upgrades. This is a dangerous path and has proven itself to be susceptible to oligarchies and collusion. There is hope in the form of on chain token signaling with non-binding resolutions that are then executed by a trusted committee. Don't worry, I won't only be bitching about on chain governance with no solutions.",
