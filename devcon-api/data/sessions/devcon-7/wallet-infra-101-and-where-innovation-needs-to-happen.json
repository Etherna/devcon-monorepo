  "title": "Wallet Infra 101, & where innovation needs to happen",
  "description": "In this talk I hope to go over the infrastructure stack of a standard wallet, and then also go into where in this stack I think innovation should happen/is already happening and why that's exciting. This will also broadly cover other related topics such as: \r\n- The future state of crypto UI & dapp interactions\r\n- What crypto wallets can learn from web2 apps \r\n- My framework around \"What users can do with their balance?\", and how wallets can use that to build new features",
