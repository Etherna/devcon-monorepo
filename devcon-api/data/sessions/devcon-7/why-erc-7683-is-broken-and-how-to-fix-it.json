  "title": "Why ERC 7683 is broken and how to fix it",
  "description": "While I appreciate the authors spending time on this problem statement and thinking about standardising flows, ERC 7683 is deeply flawed it still forces offchain agents to understand the order they are trying to fulfill and it doesnt give users any guarantees of execution or understanding of whats happening under the hood, I think its because its standardising things on the \"intent\" layer where instead we need to standardise more downstream so information like security can be better presented",
