  "title": "L2 EVM Common Core: A Path Beyond EVM Equivalence",
  "description": "Network effects of the EVM have locked many of the L2s into equivalence with the L1 EVM. L1 is optimized for moderate throughput and maximal decentralization, but L2s need higher throughput and can rely on heavier full nodes.\r\n\r\nThe talk will present a vision for an L2 EVM Common Core as a new base VM for participating L2s. It aims to offer a way to ship more ambitious EVM changes without increasing L2 fragmentation. It is a result of our work as leads of the RollCall L2 coordination process.",
