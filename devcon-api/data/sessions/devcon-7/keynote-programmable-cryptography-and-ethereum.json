  "description": "Programmable Cryptography is a \"second generation\" of cryptographic primitives - primitives that allow arbitrary programs to be executed \"inside of\" or \"on top of\" cryptographic objects. Programmable cryptography provides three key affordances that complement and amplify the affordances of Ethereum--verifiability, confidentiality, and non-interactivity. We'll discuss how these technologies can reshape the Internet over the next 50 years.",
