  "description": "RLN is a protocol designed to prevent DoS attacks in a privacy-preserving manner. It uses zero-knowledge proof to limit the number of actions a user can take. In a p2p network, it can be used to limit messages sent over a period of time by one sender. RLNâ€™s latest upgrade limits to N (instead of 1) messages per epoch. Also, the Merkle tree is now built on-chain, greatly improving the UX.\r\n\r\nCome learn how to use an implementation of RLNv2 to DoS protect a peer-to-peer network.",
