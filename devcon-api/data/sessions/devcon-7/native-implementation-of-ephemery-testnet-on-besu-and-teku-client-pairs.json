  "title": "Native Implementation of Ephemery Testnet on Besu & Teku Client Pairs",
  "description": "This presentation covers the work done to enable native support for Ephemery on Teku and Besu clients. Ephemery is a short-lived, resettable testnet designed to automatically revert to its genesis state after a defined period, making it ideal for intensive, short-term testing without concerns over issues like insufficient testnet funds, inactive validators, or state bloat that long-running testnets often face.",
