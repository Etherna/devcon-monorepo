  "title": "A DAG-Based Mechanism for Fairer and More Decentralized Reward Distribution",
  "description": "Ethereum rewards validators for their correct and timely votes, incentivizing honest behavior and ensuring security. Although Ethereum has advanced large-scale decentralization, its current mechanism for verifying timely attestations is not entirely decentralized. This presentation highlights a bottleneck in Ethereum's reward distribution that could compromise LMD GHOST security. We propose a distributed DAG-based reward mechanism to enhance security, fairness, and incentive compatibility.",
