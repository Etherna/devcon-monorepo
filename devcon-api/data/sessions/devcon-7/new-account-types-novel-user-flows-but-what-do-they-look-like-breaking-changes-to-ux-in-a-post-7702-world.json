  "title": "New account types =  novel user flows, but what do they look like? Breaking changes to UX in a post-7702 world",
  "description": "The wallet world has evolved to embrace contract accounts (4337 and 7702), app-owned wallets, session keys (CAIP-25), and permissions controls (7715). How might we on the app layer design and build upon these new account types? In this talk, I will demonstrate the possibilities for novel user flows given these new account standards, compare how these new standards can introduce pitfalls, and provide best practices on how to design for app layer in a post-7702 world.",
