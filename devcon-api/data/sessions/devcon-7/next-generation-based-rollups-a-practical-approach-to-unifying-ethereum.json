  "title": "Next Generation Based Rollups: A Practical Approach to Unifying Ethereum",
  "description": "I plan to speak on the concept of based sequencing (based rollups). I want to not only introduce the concept but also explain recent developments (what I like to call next generation based rollups). This includes based preconfirmations, fast->realtime proving, customizable composability, practical synchronous composability, among others. I will introduce I also plan to provide a brief summary to my Bankless Summit talk on ETH value accrual in the presence of based rollups.",
