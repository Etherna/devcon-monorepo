  "title": "Austin Griffith –  Intro to Scaffold-ETHv2 - SpeedRunEthereum1",
  "description": "In this session, we’re going to dive into Scaffold-ETH v2, a toolkit we built to make developing on Ethereum way easier. We’ll take a look at how it works, why it’s super useful for quickly spinning up projects, and how we can use it to tinker with smart contracts and hook up the frontend. \r\n\r\n⚙️ Scaffold-ETH 2 is built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Foundry/Hardhat, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re new or experienced, we’ll get you to SpeedRunEthereum!",
