  "title": "Community Currencies: The Price of Attention and Cost of Influence in a Networked Age",
  "description": "Human attention is a key input to AIs, while also a target of influence in marketplaces and elections. At the same time, money and voting are adversarial mechanisms for apportioning influence, often ending in conflict and capture when provisioning private and public goods. This talk introduces a model for community currencies that seeks to price attention, leveraging money and voting as complements to make AIs accountable and provision a greater breadth of goods between public and private.",
