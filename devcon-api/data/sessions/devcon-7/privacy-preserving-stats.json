  "description": "Privacy-preserving Stats is a framework allowing data consumers to query statistical computation from either one or multiple data providers while preserving privacy to those raw data. We support standard statistical operations, including nested and filter ones. Data providers do not leak their data and data consumers can be convinced the computation is done correctly.",
