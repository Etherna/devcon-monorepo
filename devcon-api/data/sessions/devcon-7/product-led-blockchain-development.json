  "description": "As teams spin up new app-specific rollups and L2s, we've moved into an era of product-led blockchain development. In this model, developers are not only building the first product or client to leverage their protocol, but establishing what ‘product-defined blockspace’ means. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I go over the history of product-led growth, how it evolved to product-led protocol development in web3, and finally, what product-led blockchain development means in the context of app-specific rollups.",
