This session will be a sequence of guided small group discussions that will flesh out the levels of a <b>capability maturity model</b> for how a commons resource, whether it is a blockchain or a city, can be gradually \"hardened\" by developing and maturing capabilities at material, philosophical, skill, social, and mission levels.",
