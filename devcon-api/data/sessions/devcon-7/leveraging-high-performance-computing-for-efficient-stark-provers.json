  "title": "Leveraging High-Performance Computing for Efficient STARK Provers",
  "description": "Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) protocols' applicability hinges on the prover's ability to efficiently generate proofs. This talk explores the computational aspects affecting ZKP performance, specifically focusing on STARK provers. We will analyze performance across high-performance and standard computing architectures and interpret results by examining key workload characteristics. From this understanding, we can project ZKP capabilities in future scenarios.",
