  "description": "Let's explore the overlooked \"understory\" of DAOs and teams: the human layer that forms the foundation of successful decentralized governance. While much attention is given to the technical and structural aspects of DAOs (the \"overstory\"), we'll dive into the cultural, social, and distributed leadership elements that are crucial for the longevity and effectiveness of anything we build.\r\n\r\nThemes: DAO Ecology, Decentralized leadership, Coding culture DNA, Biomimicry for Governance",
