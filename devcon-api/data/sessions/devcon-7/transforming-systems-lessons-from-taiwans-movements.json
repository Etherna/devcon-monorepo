  "description": "I will talk about the most recent struggles of open source communities in Taiwan, g0v specifically, how da0 has been trying to help in the past year or so, the conclusions we had and what is still missing. g0v has been running bi-monthly hackathons for 10 years now, which has been the key foundation for the community. April this year they stopped due to lack of funding support, we use this as a point of reference and how a web3 oriented subgroup like da0 could have done better, and the future.",
