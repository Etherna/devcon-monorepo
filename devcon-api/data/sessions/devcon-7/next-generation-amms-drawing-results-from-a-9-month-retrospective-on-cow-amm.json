  "title": "Next generation AMMs: drawing results from a 9-month retrospective on CoW AMM",
  "description": "Loss-Versus-Rebalancing (LVR) is the most significant form of MEV, yet it has the fewest solutions addressing it. LVR remains a significant challenge for AMMs. This session delves into a comprehensive analysis of how CoW AMM addresses the problem of LVR through its unique batch mechanism. Drawing from 9 months of empirical data, the talk will explore the effectiveness of CoW AMM in mitigating LVR and offer insights into the impact of LVR resistant design on trading outcomes and market efficiency",
