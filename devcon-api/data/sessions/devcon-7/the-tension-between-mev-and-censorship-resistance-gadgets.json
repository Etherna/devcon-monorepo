  "title": "The tension between MEV and Censorship Resistance Gadgets",
  "description": "Although fairly unrelated at first glance, MEV is currently *the* bottleneck for a censorship-resistant Ethereum. This talk will first explore why MEV and censorship resistance are fundamentally counterforces. Then, we will dive into how MEV constrains the design space of censorship-resistant gadgets like Inclusion Lists and Concurrent Block Producers. What does the future of censorship resistance look like for Ethereum?",
