  "description": "Recently Reth and Geth released respectively the ExEx and live tracers feature which resemble eachother. They both provide realtime and rich access to chain/state events and data. As tracers start to persist this data and explor ways to expose them to users, a question arises. Are they a way for devs not only to read data but to extend the functionality of the client, i.e. by publishing an additional API?",
