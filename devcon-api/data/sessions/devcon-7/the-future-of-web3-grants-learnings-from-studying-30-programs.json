  "title": "The Future of Web3 Grants: Learnings from Studying 30+ Programs",
  "description": "This presentation will cover learnings from studying almost 3 dozen grant programs across multiple chains and ecosystems. I will present an overview of the state of grants across Ethereum as well as Bitcoin, Cardano, Solana, and other chains. I will present on the most pressing challenges for grant operators, feedback from grantees on their experiences, and will present a potential path forward in terms of collective priorities that can help all programs improve.",
