  "title": "Visual code of cypherpunk, and lessons from subcultural aesthetics we should remember on the road to mass adoption",
  "description": "I want to take builders on the turbulent ride through how subcultural and social movements used their visual codes when spreading globally, and what design tasks are still ahead of us on the way to making Ethereum cypherpunk again and onboarding the next billion users to Web3 at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis ride will include three stops:\r\n1. waving one's emotional state into the collective identity\r\n2. using shared aesthetics as a signal of belonging\r\n3. coordinating a collective design process.",
