  "title": "Interoperability between L2s: Latest developments, Framework and Challenges",
  "description": "The number of L2s is growing rapidly and itâ€™s crucial to create strong interoperability solutions to reduce liquidity fragmentation and friction for users. We provide a framework for analyzing interoperability solutions that defines 6 levels of interoperability. For each level, we deep dive the consequences on UX, DevEx, scalability, fee structures, and MEV potential. We also provide an ecosystem map categorizing the level of interoperability offered by existing projects.",
