  "description": "Ethereum's rollup-centric approach has led to the emergence of L2 Rollup Clusters reducing fees but creating fragmented liquidity and a less seamless user experience. Third-party bridges, though helpful, are cumbersome, vulnerable to hacks ($2B losses to date), and costly, leading to high fees.
