  "description": "Key custody remains a tricky problem to solve. Most of the focus around improving the security of key custody revolve around software based approaches like secret sharing. However, physical approaches are also possible. \r\n\r\nThis talk discusses on how to secure secrets using microdots and how microdots may be fabricated at home with legally accessible tools.\r\n\r\nMicrodots is a technique which allows one to shrink documents down. This allows one to embed secrets in documents in plain sight.",
