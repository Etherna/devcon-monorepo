  "description": "Key custody remains a tricky problem to solve. Most of the focus around improving the security of key custody revolve around software based approaches like secret sharing. However, physical approaches are also possible. This talk intends on discussing on how to secure secrets using microdots and how microdots may be fabricated at home with simple tools. \r\n\r\nMicrodots are a way of encoding messages in a tiny film which may be embedded secretly in covert documents.",
