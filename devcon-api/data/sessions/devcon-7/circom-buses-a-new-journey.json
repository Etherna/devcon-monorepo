  "description": "Circom is one of the most widely used languages in programmable cryptography. In this talk we present an amazing new circom feature, called buses. Like structs in other languages, programmers can define their own buses, as new types, in a general way to create structured collections of signals and freely use them in their code. Buses increase the readability, modularity and security of circuits. Illustrative examples as well as the renewed circomlib, using buses, are presented.",
