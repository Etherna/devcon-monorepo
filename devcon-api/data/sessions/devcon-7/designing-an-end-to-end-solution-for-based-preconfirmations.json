  "title": "Designing an End to End Solution for Based Preconfirmations",
  "description": "This workshop provides the audience with a foundation for building an end-to-end solution to deliver fast preconfirmation of transactions on a based-rollup like Taiko. In addition to understanding the basics of based sequencing and preconfirmations, attendees will learn about settling these preconfirmations as an Eigenlayer AVS, designing the AVS client, syncing L2 state using preconfirmed blocks, preconfer election, and managing a proposer lookahead using Beacon state within smart contracts.",
