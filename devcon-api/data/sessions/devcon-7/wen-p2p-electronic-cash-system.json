  "description": "16 years have passed since Bitcoin whitepaper came out. Bitcoin was created as cypherpunk cash replacement. Cash means easy payments. But bitcoin found its PMF as 'digital gold', not as 'digital cash'. What happened to cash? What needs to happen for mass adoption of crypto payments?\r\nWe will go through the history of failed attempts. We'll end up with a hopeful analysis of why it's different in 2024 (spoiler alert: stablecoin adoption, cheap L2s, AA).",
