  "title": "Payments as an Integration Problem",
  "description": "Can we integrate many aspects of payments into a unified model across all of Ethereum? Should we?\r\n\r\nWe'll look at payment considerations such as\r\n- Freedom & decentralization.\r\n- Multiple chains, tokens, currencies, wallets, and VMs.\r\n- Dividing customer segments and use cases into parts that are clearly similar and parts that are clearly different.\r\n- Payment methods such as sends, bridges, swaps, onramps, unsecured credit, and defi positions.\r\n\r\nEnjoy a glimpse into payments futurism!",
