  "description": "One-off audits can provide a good security baseline but fall short in continuous security assurance, especially for upgradeable and actively developed protocols. We'll cover how to set up the smart contract development processes to ensure the top level of security guarantees, including design review and property specification stages, as well as the integration of security tooling, including testing, fuzzing, and formal verification, into the CI pipeline and development lifecycle of a protocol.",
