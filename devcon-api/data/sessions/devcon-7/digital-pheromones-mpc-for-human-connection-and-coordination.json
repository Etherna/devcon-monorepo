  "title": "Digital pheromones: MPC for human connection & coordination",
  "description": "Recent MPC research from Cursive and PSE enables a new concept called \"digital pheromones\": the ability to produce lightweight, privacy-preserving signals that people can use to coordinate safely and efficiently.\r\n\r\nThe primary result we will cover is Trinity, a new 2PC scheme with nearly ideal UX/DevX, built on the trio of PLONK, Garbled Circuits, and KZG Witness Encryption. We will do a live demo with attendees and explore what a future filled with digital pheromones will enable!",
