  "title": "iExec: Allowing Scalable, Efficient and Virtualized Off-chain Execution for Arbitrary Applications",
  "description": "This presentation is a follow-up to Devcon2 and EDCON. We’ll introduce the iExec SDK that allows to execute any legacy applications from Ethereum smart contracts. Using a set of simple CLI tools, developers can register, deploy and administrate their applications in the iExec distributed Cloud. We’ll present examples that explain the solidity smart contract API and illustrate off-chain computations.",
