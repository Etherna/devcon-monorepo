  "description": "We present Securify (www.securify.ch), the first push-button security auditing tool for Ethereum smart contracts that is fully automated, easily extensible to new security vulnerabilities, and provides strong security guarantees. The core technical idea behind Securify is to soundly extract deep semantic information from the smart contract using automated abstract reasoning. This information is then used to ensure the absence of critical security vulnerabilities, such as reentrant calls, unprivileged storage accesses, and many others. Securify precisely analyzes real-world smart contracts within seconds, and handles any language that compiles to Ethereum bytecode.",
