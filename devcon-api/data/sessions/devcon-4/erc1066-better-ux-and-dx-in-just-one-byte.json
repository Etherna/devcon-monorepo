  "description": "This talk discusses ERC1066: a common set of Ethereum status codes (\"ESC\") in the same vein as signals, tagged tuples, and HTTP status codes. They provide an opt-in way of enriching payloads with a finite set of shared metadata. ESCs improve smart contract autonomy, UX, and DX, with clear application for localization, wallet integration, and contract interoperability. Code layout, Solidity and JS helper libraries,  and tooling are all designed with developer experience in mind. While much broader than errors, ESCs are fully compatible with revert-with-message, with the added bonus of being localized for the end user. Come see the difference a byte makes!",
