This breakout session aims to educate participants on the history, major groups, and interactive tools around Ethereum governance. We will have representation from major governance bodies such as the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians, EIP editors, and core developers. The activities in the breakout session will include short presentations from each governance group, a Q&A session, and demos of software and tools used in the governance process, such as exciting new voting/signaling tools.",
