  "title": "A Correct by Construction Asynchronous Casper Protocol",
  "description": "This technical talk covers the ongoing formal verification and implementation efforts behind a correct-by-construction asynchronous byzantine-fault tolerant binary version of the Casper consensus protocol that is currently under development. Work extending the correct-by-construction approach to virtual machine replication, validator rotation and public economic consensus will also be discussed.",
