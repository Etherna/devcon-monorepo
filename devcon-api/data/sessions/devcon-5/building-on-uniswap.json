  "title": "Building on Uniswap",
  "description": "Uniswap is an automated market maker on Ethereum. It can be used directly as an exchange, but arguably its most interesting use is as a building block for other protocols and applications. This talk will discuss how Uniswap was designed to favor composability, including offering synchronous contract-accessible liquidity, turning pooled market maker liquidity into its own fungible asset, and aiming for simplicity and efficiency rather than completeness. The talk will demonstrate ways in which Uniswap can be composed with other protocols to create new kinds of on-chain financial products. The talk will also preview some future features of Uniswap—ERC20-ERC20 pairs and Uniswap-based price oracles—and show how they would expand Uniswap’s usefulness as a building block of decentralized finance.",
