  "title": "Smart Contract as a Service: Using messages to share contracts",
  "description": "Currently, developers deploy multiple copies of the same contract to the Ethereum blockchain. But with a shared global system, why not deploy contracts once and make them available for everyone?Learning from the actor model of message passing and the ERC1066 Status Codes Standard, I will present a model for “smart contract as a service”. This style of contract design can lead to highly vetted and secure contracts that anyone can re-use. Their persistence and re-use means we can also write integrations so that non-smart contract developers can make use of them off chain.",
