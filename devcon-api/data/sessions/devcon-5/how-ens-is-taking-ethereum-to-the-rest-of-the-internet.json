  "title": "How ENS is taking Ethereum to the rest of the Internet",
  "description": "ENS is forming a bridge connecting the Ethereum and legacy Internet communities. We are doing this with DNS domain integration; support for other cryptocurrency addresses; resolution for IPFS and Tor .onion addresses; working on securing a new DNS record type for Ethereum addresses; relationships with ICANN, IETF, et al; and working on supportÂ for DNS records and other cryptocurrency addresses. This helps to further entrench ENS and therefore Ethereum as a basic piece of Internet infrastructure, used widely by people whether they are a part of the blockchain community or not.",
