  "title": "Scaling your favourite dapp with ZkRollup",
  "description": "Rollup allows dapps to scale by using ethereum as the data availability layer and using snarks to create an off-chain execution environment where your dapp business logic can run easily. Rollup aggregates transactions so that they only require a single on-chain transactions required to validate multiple other transactions. The snark checks the signature and applies the transaction to the leaf that the signer owns. Multiple users create signatures. Provers aggregate these signatures into snark and use it to update a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain. A malicious prover who does not also have that leaf's private key cannot change a leaf. Only the person who controls the private key can. This is intended to be the database layer of snark-dapp (snaps) where the layers above define more rules about changing and updating the leaves Rollup does not make any rules about what happens in a leaf, what kind of leaves can be created and destroyed.",
