  "description": "The Incubed protocol is an incentivized, secure and fully decentralized protocol for stateless ultra light clients. It is specially designed for devices or applications which are restricted in available resources like memory, calculation power, connectivity or bandwidth. During the workshop, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of non-synchronizing (stateless) clients and demonstrate with comprehensible programming examples how mobile apps, web applications and especially IoT applications can be realized with minimal resource consumption using the  Incubed client.  In the second part, we will take a closer look at the proofs used by the  Incubed protocol to verify the correctness of blockchain information. In a  programming challenge, we will examine how those proofs work in the application  context.",
