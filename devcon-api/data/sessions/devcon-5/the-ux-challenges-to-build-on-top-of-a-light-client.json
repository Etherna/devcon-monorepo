  "description": "In the past year, we have been building Fether, a wallet based on a  light client. Although the connection to a node is a fundamental part of building a DApp, it is often considered secondary as connection can be  achieved for free using a 3rd party node. We will present the UX  patterns that we have developed in Fether to allow for a great UX,  without necessarily have access to a full node.",
