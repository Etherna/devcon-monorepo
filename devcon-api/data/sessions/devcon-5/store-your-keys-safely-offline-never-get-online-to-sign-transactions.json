  "description": "The best way to keep your private key safe, is to keep it disconnected from the internet. This is usually done in hardware wallet, however most of those wallets are directly connected to a computer, either via usb or bluetooth. What if the wallet was never online and never ever connected to an online device. This is achievable using QR code. We did it with Parity Signer. I will present why we built it, how, do a short live demo, and what we will do in the future.",
