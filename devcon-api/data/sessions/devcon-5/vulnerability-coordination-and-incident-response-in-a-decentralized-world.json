  "description": "Thereâ€™s one question that every team of core blockchain developers has discussed at least once: what are we going to do when a critical vulnerability in our software is surfaced? By definition, everything we create is likely to include a vulnerability or code flaw and the difficult legal, ethical, and business issues arise when bugs show up in code. While decentralization does not require us to reinvent the first principles security, it does force us to challenge ourselves to manage significant complexity to reduce harm to those who depend on our code. This talk will discuss the CosmosCERT as a model for how teams can successfully coordinate vulnerabilities and respond to incidents in decentralized environments using on-chain governance mechanisms in a way that ensures stakeholders have a dedicated emergency response capabilities ready to go when the worst happens.",
