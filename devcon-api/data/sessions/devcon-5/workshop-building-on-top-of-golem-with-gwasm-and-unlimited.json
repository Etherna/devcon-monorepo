  "title": "Workshop: Building on top of Golem with gWasm and Unlimited",
  "description": "Are you ready for a thrill of doing something new and exciting? Would you like playing with WebAssembly on Golem Network? During the workshop, we will demonstrate a set up of a Golem Unlimited cluster - including machines brought by the audience. We will showcase how to distribute the execution of existing apps within the ad-hoc infrastructure. You will have an opportunity to run 3 apps with source-code available and code your own app using the simplistic API and cross-compile to Wasm target. Attending the workshop will give you the tools and knowledge to tackle our white-hat hacker challenge. Stay alert!  To fully experience hands-on experience in the workshop, please install the docker on your machine and doÂ `docker pull golemfactory/gwasm-tutorial`beforehand.",
