  "title": "Compositionality: The 10x Engineer Secret Sauce",
  "description": "Proponents of blockchains argue that compositionality is a key feature. What is compositionality though?  Maybe surprisingly, there is a rich mathematical framework in which the concept can be made precise as a theory of systems. In this workshop, we provide a primer of that theory and we showcase two practical applications based on it: compositionality in game theory (open games) and in formal verification (automata). The workshop is aimed at devs. There are no mathematical prerequisites.",
