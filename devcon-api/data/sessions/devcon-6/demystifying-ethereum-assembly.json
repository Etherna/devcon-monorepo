  "description": "# Demystifying Ethereum Assembly The EVM creates an economic incentive to minimize computation and data storage. This leads to extreme gas optimizations in a few different assembly languages and patterns. In this workshop, we will learn about EVM assembly through both a walkthrough of EVM basics and real-world, practical examples of assembly. This workshop assumes an intermediate level understanding of programming and at least a beginner understanding of Ethereum.",
