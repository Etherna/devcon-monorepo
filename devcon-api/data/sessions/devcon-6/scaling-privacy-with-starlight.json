  "description": "Five years ago, at DevCon in Prague, EY took the wraps off Nightfall, our open source public domain approach to privacy. Now it's live on Ethereum as a layer 2 privacy-enabled ZK-optimistic roll-up solution called Polygon Nightfall.  That's only half the story though - we also need private smart contracts.  This talk will cover our roadmap to that end, including our newest tool in development (also open source) called Starlight.",
