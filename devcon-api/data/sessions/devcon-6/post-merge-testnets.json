  "description": "The merge of the beacon-chain consensus layer with the EVM execution layer is a major milestone for Ethereum, if not the most significant. The changes introduced are also affecting testing infrastructure. It's an excellent opportunity to look at the public testnet infrastructure, compare the various networks, and present the Sepolia and Goerli testnets to teams and developers still relying on Kovan, Rinkeby, or Ropsten.",
