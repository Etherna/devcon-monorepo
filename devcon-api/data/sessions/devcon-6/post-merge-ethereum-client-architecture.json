  "description": "Take a look at the key components of a post-merge Ethereum \"node\" and how they fit together, encompassing both the consensus and execution clients. How do the two clients work together? What impact does the different designs of clients have on that? And what opportunities are there for execution and consensus clients to work together better in the future? Let's break down the knowledge silos between consensus and execution layers to get the most out of merged future of Ethereum.",
