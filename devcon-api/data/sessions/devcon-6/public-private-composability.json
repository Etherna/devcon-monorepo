  "description": "Learn about the challenges of designing a private execution layer for Ethereum. Previously, smart contract execution (L1 & L2) has been fully public. Some apps provide basic private functionality for a single private state (e.g. privacy coins). We'll discuss ways to execute general private and public state changes across multiple smart contracts in one transaction, within a zk-rollup. This unlocks programmable private smart contracts.",
