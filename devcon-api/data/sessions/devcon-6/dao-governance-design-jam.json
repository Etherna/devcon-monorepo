  "description": "Premiered during devconnect in Amsterdam earlier this year, the DAO Governance Design Jam is a workshop focussed on common DAO governance issues. Leveraging design-thinking methodologies, we will guide participants through the innovation processâ€”alternating between divergent and convergent thinking. At the start of the workshop we will pick a workshop goal based on what resonates most with the group, upon which we will facilitate the creative process and open-source the resulting innovations.",
