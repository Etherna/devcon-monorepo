  "description": "I have been programming since the days of BASIC and Assembly. I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science in Korea and worked at an AI startup specializing in cybersecurity. I took online courses on startups from Balaji and have been following blockchain since 2012. Two years ago, I transitioned to full-time freelancing in the blockchain space. This year, I took a leap of faith and decided to explore ideas for my own blockchain company.",
