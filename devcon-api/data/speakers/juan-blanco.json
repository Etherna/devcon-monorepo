  "description": "I’m Juan Blanco, creator of Nethereum, an open-source .NET library and framework for Ethereum. Since 2015, I’ve contributed to the Ethereum community through Nethereum and the Solidity extension for Visual Studio Code. With 24+ years in .NET and experience as an architect, I focus on Ethereum technologies, smart contracts, and decentralized apps. I hope to help the Ethereum ecosystem grow by leveraging the .NET framework to reach across web, gaming, backend, enterprise, mobile, and desktop.",
