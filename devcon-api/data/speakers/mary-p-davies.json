She recently completed a critical evaluation of social recovery wallets in the context of trust law.  Her current research focus is holder fallibility, the role the holder plays in the transfer of Eth and other digital assets, and how that role can be completed in situations where the holder is temporarily, or permanently, unable to fulfil their role.",
