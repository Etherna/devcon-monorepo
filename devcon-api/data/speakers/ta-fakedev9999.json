  "description": "I'm ZK Engineer at [Kroma](https://kroma.network), securing the network with Zero-Knowledge Fault Proofs and scaling Ethereum through advanced cryptographic techniques. I have implemented various features in [Tachyon](https://github.com/kroma-network/tachyon), which is a modular ZK backend accelerated by GPU, from cryptographic primitives to proving schemes and optimizations; Finite Fields, Polynomials, FFT, Halo2, etc. I'm eager to solve real-world problems with practical solutions.",
