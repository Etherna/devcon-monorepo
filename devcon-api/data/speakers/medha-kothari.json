  "description": "Medha currently does Product for Uniswap Labs. She found herself absolutely enraptured by crypto back in 2017 because of what she learned at Blockchain @ Berkeley, and since then has served in a variety of roles in crypto -- first as a software engineer for the Celo Protocol, then as a VC at Variant Fund, and now as a PM at Uniswap. On nights and weekends she started a nonprofit called she256 to increase diversity in the space.",
