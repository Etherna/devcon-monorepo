  "description": "Crypto enthusiast since the 2017 Ethereum ICO craze, been developing smart contracts, dapps and fiddling with Ethereum staking tools ever since. For the past few years, my interest was mostly in finding the most efficient and cheapest entry point to become an Ethereum staker, leveraging the newest ARM64 and recently, RISC-V boards.\r\n\r\nMy background is software engineering with more than 15 years of experience, mostly in the cloud computing area, Kubernetes and operating systems.",
