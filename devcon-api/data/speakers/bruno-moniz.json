  "description": "I’m deeply fascinated by the intersection of technology and economics—Ethereum captures this perfectly. I work as a Blockchain Engineer on the Emerging Technologies team at Inter, diving into blockchain projects and playing a role in the DREX pilot, Brazil’s CBDC initiative. Also a proud founding member of Bankless Brasil. Plant-based, training for a triathlon, and an avid climber.",
