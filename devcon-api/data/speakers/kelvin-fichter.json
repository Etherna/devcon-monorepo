  "description": "Sup nerds, I'm Kelvin. I've been working on building L2s in the Optimism universe for the better part of the last six years or so. I also previously did R&D on Plasma, an early model for L2s before Rollups took over. I currently do a variety of things over at OP Labs but generally have a focus on core smart contract development for the OP Stack.",
