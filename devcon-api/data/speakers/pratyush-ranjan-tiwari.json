  "description": "I will soon receive my PhD from  Johns Hopkins University under the wonderful supervision of both Matthew Green and Abhishek Jain. One of the key focuses of my research during my PhD has been the security and construction of efficient SNARKs and proof systems, particularly those involving error-correcting codes: this work was funded by an EF grant!\r\n\r\nI am now founding eternis.ai! We are working on infrastructure for attribute-based communications and transactions onchain.",
