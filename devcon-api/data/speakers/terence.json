  "description": "I'm passionate about open-source and have been actively involved in Ethereum protocol development since late 2018. I started Prysm, a consensus layer implementation in Go, with a few others. I'm an author of several EIPs for inclusion and ePBS. I love Ethereum, and I can't wait to work on it for a thousand more years!",
