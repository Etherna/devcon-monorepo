  "description": "I am an Ethereum enthusiast with a deep love for all things servers. I started my journey with Bitcoin as a high schooler in 2011 and gradually made my way to Ethereum. I currently work in the DevOps team of the Ethereum Foundation and I mainly focus on the Ethereum protocol upgrades.\r\n\r\nIâ€™m a huge believer in the transparency that blockchains enable, I think that the democratization of this transparent data is a vital feature that Ethereum unlocks for us.",
