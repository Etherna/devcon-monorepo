  "description": "I started working on self sovereign identity in my first contact with web3/Ethereum back in 2018. Concretely in Iden3. Started kind of a spin off to build the rollupPoC, a proof-of-concept zkRollup (only payments) using zk-language circom. That was the seed for the Hermez network where I got the role of protocol engineer. Hermez evolution was Polygon zkEVM, where I was the team lead in the protocol team where we code the EVM in a new zk language, zkASM.",
