  "description": "I am a researcher in cryptography at Consensys, where I work on efficient arguments of knowledge for the Linea layer 2, with a focus on both research and engineering aspects. In Spring 2023, I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from ETH Zurich. During my PhD, my main research interests were on foundational cryptography, mainly focused on zero-knowledge, but also delving into topics such as advanced encryption primitives and signatures.",
