  "description": "I've been coding since 10yo, in that time I've went through multiple fields: I started with game dev, then switched to systems: I made my own Linux distribution at the age of 15, focused on improving the Linux UX: it peaked at p9 on distrowatch. I cofounded a media center that grew to >35m users (Stremio)\r\n\r\nMore recently I've taken on a challenge to combine all my skills, namely UX, security and smart contracts, to push the crypto UX forward in the form of a next-gen smart wallet, ambire.com",
