  "description": "For 2013-2023 period I was a pure mathematician, studying low-dimensional topology and symplectic geometry in Princeton, Indiana and Stony Brook Universities. I got interested in crypto as early as 2015, and did some investments and research in Ethereum ecosystem on the side. In 2022 I also taught a course on blockchains in Stony Brook (artofkot.xyz/blockchain-course), and in 2023 move into the space full-time, as a research lead in cyber.fund.",
