  "description": "I work at the Ethereum Foundation, on the team EF Portal team. I wanted to solve problems as a kid and ended up here. My focus is on Execution Lightclients, our Portal History and State network. I fix all the scary bugs, and I am currently working on using an EVM and executing all the blocks to latest for our State Network, building Trin Execution. Trin is the name of the Portal Client I work on at the EF and it is built in Rust.",
