  "description": "I've been involved full-time in the blockchain space since 2020, but experimenting with the tech on a personal level since 2013, mostly on privacy-focused solutions.\r\nWith a full-stack background, I define myself a solidity dev with an architectural view when it comes to develop applications in Web3. Currently I'm the Co-founder of Fluidkey, bringing default-privacy with great UX on EVMs.\r\nOutside blockchain space, I'm a basketball lover, LEGO nerd and roller-coaster enthusiast.",
