  "description": "I have two passions: Technological entrepreneurship and XC mountain biking. As VP Engineering at StarkWare, where I've been working since 2017, I run our engineering department responsible for the development of Starknet, STARK proving and related services. I bike to and from our offices almost every day all year round. For over 25 years I've held CEO, CTO, Chief Architect and Distinguished Technologist positions in various startup companies."
