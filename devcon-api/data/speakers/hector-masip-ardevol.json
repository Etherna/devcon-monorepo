  "description": "I am currently working as a research engineer at Polygon. In this role, I contribute to the development of a robust arithmetization, in terms of the extended Algebraic Intermediate Representation (eAIR), for various projects such as the Polygon zkEVM. Furthermore, I ensure the completeness and soundness of the underlying proving system that we use, apart from doing research on the topic of cryptographic proving systems.",
