  "description": "Over the last five years I have been leading the development of circom, one of the main DSLs for defining ZK protocols. I have also extensively worked on developing tools and techniques for the analysis of smart contracts and on the generation of optimized EVM code (as part of funded projects by the EF). I am also leading the ZK-ARCKIT project (funded by the EF) to provide tools to analyze, transform and optimize the polynomial constraint systems generated for building ZK proofs.",
