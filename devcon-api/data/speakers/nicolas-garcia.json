  "description": "I am a blockchain security researcher with over five years of experience. I spend time at OpenZeppelin, protecting some of the leading projects in the space. Along the way, I discovered a passion for Rust—my favorite language for just about everything—and I especially love diving into Rust codebases to audit and secure them.",
