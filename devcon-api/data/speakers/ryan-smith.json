  "description": "I started Index Supply in 2022. Before that I co-founded Chain and before that I was #18 at Heroku. I am obsessed with systems programming and decentralized tech. I value simplicity and building from first principles. I will talk endlessly about: databases, lisp, and doing more with less.",
