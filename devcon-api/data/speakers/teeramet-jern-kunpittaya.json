  "description": "Hi, Im Jern, a theoretical CS undergrad alumni from Columbia University. I love understanding knowledge/research fundamentally, trying to bridge them into application. Im currently a research engineer at PSE, tinkering at the intersection of zkp, mpc and fhe. Besides programmable cryptography, I'm very very passionate about education and how to empower people, hence core-contributing to EthPadThai, a Thailand grassroot web3 community.",
