We will open up a Waiting List after our final wave of General Admission tickets have sold out. In the event of cancellations, tickets will be granted to those on the Waiting List in the order that they signed up. We strongly encourage anybody looking to purchase a ticket from a third party to do it through email & copy support@devcon.org.
