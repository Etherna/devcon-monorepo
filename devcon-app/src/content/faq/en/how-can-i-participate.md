First, we advise [bridging funds to Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) ahead of time. The entirety of the Auction & Raffle will take place on Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer 2 rollup. Therefore, we will only accept ETH as a method of payment. Once bridged, you can head over to [raffle.devcon.org](https://raffle.devcon.org/) to place a bid. Please note that smart contract wallets like Argent & Gnosis safe will not be compatible with the Auction+Raffle this year.
