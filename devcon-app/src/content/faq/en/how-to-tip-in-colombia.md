title: How to tip in Colombia?

[Tipping culture](http://www.wanderluluu.com/tipping-in-colombia/) differs depending on the service! At restaurants, a voluntary 10% is custom, and could be included in advance for larger parties. It’s also fine (but not expected) to round up with street vendors.

And if someone helps you with your bags, tipping hotel staff is kind in all countries. But for many attending from North America or the Eurozone, the 2000 COP that you may chip in adds up to under $/€1.00.
