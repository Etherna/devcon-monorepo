We will be implementing whatever COVID requirements are mandated by the government of Colombia at the start of the event. Currently as of June 2022, there are no restrictions. 

We’re also happy to mention that our venue Ágora Bogotá has [has qualified for Bureau Veritas Safe Guard certification](https://agora-bogota.com/en/protocolos-bioseguridad), meaning they have satisfied a rigorous set of biosafety criteria operationally and in their physical space.

As the global situation continues to improve, our team will actively monitor and provide updated plans to our [Devcon Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/category/devcon/), [@EFDevcon Twitter](https://twitter.com/EFDevcon), and [Devcon.org](https://devcon.org). Stay tuned for more!
