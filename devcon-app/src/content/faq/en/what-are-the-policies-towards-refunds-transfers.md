**Refunds** - All tickets will be refundable as long as the request is made before the start of the event. Refunds will be issued using the same payment method used to purchase the ticket: Credit card, ETH, or DAI. If the refund request is approved for a ticket paid for in cryptocurrency, you will be responsible for paying the gas fees of the transaction of the refund - gas fees will be deducted from the refunded amount. Please allow up to 4 weeks for refunds to be issued.

**Transfers** - In our effort to prevent scalping and ensure equal opportunity for all interested community members to be able to purchase tickets, we will only allow ticket transfers on a case-by-case basis upon written request to support@devcon.org. 

PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BUY OR SELL A TICKET FROM AN EXTERNAL SOURCE â€” YOU RISK BEING SCAMMED.
