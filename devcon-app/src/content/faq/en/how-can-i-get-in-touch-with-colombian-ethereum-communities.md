There are Meetups outside of Bogotá: 

Antioquia is one of the 32 departments of Colombia, and Medellín is Antioquia's capital city. There is a [Telegram group](https://t.me/ethantioquia) for Ethereum meetups and events in that region. 

The Caribbean region in the north of Colombia also has a [Telegram group](https://t.me/EthereumCaribe) and a [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/EthereumCaribe?s=12). 

Armenia is the capital city of the Quindío department in western Colombia. [Ethereum Eje Cafetero](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/ethejecafetero/) organizes regular meetups in that region located about 300km western of Botogá.
