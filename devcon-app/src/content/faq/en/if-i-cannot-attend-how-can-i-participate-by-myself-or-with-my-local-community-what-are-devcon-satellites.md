You can participate via Devcon Satellite Events! Devcon Satellite Events are an experiment to decentralize Devcon VI, to give the opportunity to foster a community amongst those who can’t make it to Bogotá due to distance, timing, costs, limited space, or other constraints, and to boost local Ethereum communities. 

You can learn more about Devcon Satellite events [here](https://forum.devcon.org/t/about-the-devcon-satellites-category/1364)
