title: Can I be a sponsor for Devcon VI?
category: general
order: 3

This year, we’re trying something new by finding new ways to support Ethereum-related public goods in lieu of a traditional Sponsorship program.

Aligned teams will have the opportunity to contribute toward Ethereum-related public goods to grow the Ethereum ecosystem, and further technologies that help us move forward together. 

As a thank you, we’ll be allocating Supporter Tickets to Devcon VI to those who give back to the community by supporting public goods that benefit Ethereum.

Applications for the Supporter Program are now closed.
