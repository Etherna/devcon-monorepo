Carbon Offsetting for Devcon VI ðŸŒ³

The community initiative, "Climate Friendly Devcon VI Dapp" enables you to compensate for your carbon dioxide emissions created by attending Devcon.

Upon entering a departure airport the dapp calculates your flight emissions and adds it to the estimated event emission per person. All transactions occur entirely on-chain.
You may immediately mint a special POAP for participating in the Devcon community offset.

After Devcon VI, the POAP also allows you to vote on which nature conservation project to retire carbon credits from. Could it be the Indigneous Reservation of the MatavÃ©n Forest in Colombia...?
You can offset your flight and get the POAP [here](https://devcon.discarbon.earth/)!

This work has resulted from over 2 years of community discussion and implementation of [DIP-17](https://devcon.org/en/dips/dip-17/) which was based on [DIP-1](https://devcon.org/en/dips/dip-1/) and [DIP-12](https://devcon.org/en/dips/dip-12/).
