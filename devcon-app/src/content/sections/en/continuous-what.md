title: Continuous.... What?
left: "### Continuous Devcon brings together a variety of opportunities for the
  community to get hands-on involved and shape the event. Furthermore, parts of
  the amazing venue will be accessible into the evening hours, enabling
  participants to continue exchanging ideas even after the main program has
  concluded for the day, **turning Devcon into a truly continuous and more
  holistic and collaboration-focused experience.**"

  The venue and space will be open, available, and welcoming until 11pm â€” much
  later than you might be used to from other Devcons. This means you can
  smoothly transition into the evening and have more time to explore the
  initiatives besides the main program!


  The venue will foster collaboration, networking, exchange, creativity, creation, experimentation and relaxation through various spaces dedicated especially to that.


  You can get hands-on involved and shape Devcon by hosting (or contributing to) a Community Hub! Learn more about the concept of Community Hubs and how to apply for one below.
