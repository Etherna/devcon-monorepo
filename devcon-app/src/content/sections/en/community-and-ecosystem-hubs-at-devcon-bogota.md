title: Community and Ecosystem Hubs at Devcon BogotÃ¡!
left: >-
  ### Community Hubs are the dedicated space at the Devcon venue from the
  community for the community. 

  By enabling a handful of communities to create and display content of their choice we pave the way for a more decentralized Devcon.


  Communities, initiatives, interest groups and collectives can apply via the DIP process for their chance to get one of the available hub areas.Once allocated a space, the selected organizing group will be solely responsible for the space and what happens in it throughout the course of the whole conference.

  ## Guidelines


  All of the community hubs must follow certain guidelines, but above all they should be:


  * Marketing-free â€” no shilling! 

  * Content first.

  * No bull ðŸ’©.

  * Tech-focused / community-focused.

  * Must offer a benefit for the audience.

  * Accessible to all Devcon attendees.

  * Dedicated to specific cause or topic.
