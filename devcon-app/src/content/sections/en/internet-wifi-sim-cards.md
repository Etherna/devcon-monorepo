## Internet and SIM Cards ðŸ’»

We will provide free SIM cards for all attendees, first-come-first-serve! They will be valid for 15 days or 20 GB, whichever comes first.

You will receive the sim cards at registration.

TIP: Make sure to have some mobile data available for when arriving at the airport, to get an Uber to your accommodation. BogotÃ¡ airport wifi is free for 30 minutes.

## Wi-Fi Info ðŸ“¶

We will have upgraded Wi-Fi at Devcon this year! However as always, providing perfect Wi-Fi for thousands of people is tricky. Please be respectful and follow the Wi-Fi guidelines provided in the Code of Conduct.
