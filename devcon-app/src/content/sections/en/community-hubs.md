Community Hubs are the dedicated space at the Devcon venue from the community for the community. By enabling a handful of communities to create and display content of their choice we pave the way for a more decentralized Devcon.

Meet this year’s Community Hubs!

Design Community Hub • Women Leaders in Web3 • Temporary Anonymous Zone • Crypto Economics & Governance • Zero Knowledge Community • ReGen Hub • ETHLatAm Community Area


## Design Community Hub

The Design Community Hub is a collaborative space for designers, creatives, founders, developers, and curious minds to stop by and learn more about the design process through interactive, engaging activities.

The Design Community Hub is a collaborative effort from various designers in our Web3 community. It proposes a gathering space for all things design at Devcon. Designers, creatives, founders, developers, and curious minds can stop by and learn more about the design process through interactive, engaging activities. Inspired by the design room at Devcon Prague, the Design Community Hub would be the space where:

1. Designers can hang out and meet each other
2. Hosts design orientated interactive activities, experiences and intimate breakouts like Onboarding and User Research Programming
3. Becomes the meeting point for developers and founders to engage with designers or see various design processes showcased through activities
4. Provides a break from “conference” chatter and transforms into a chill space for the curious to play

## Women Leaders in Web3

Center for all communities striving toward diversity, equity, and inclusion for women in Ethereum.

Our hub will showcase 50+ women leaders from across the Ethereum ecosystem. All our speakers are women. Our hub is organized by topic tracks: October 11 is community, October 12 is developer, October 13 is product and design, and October 14 is DAO and governance. We'll have a diverse schedule in several categories: panels, fireside chats, workshops, networking and office hours, crypto trivia, speed recruiting, speed friending, and professional headshots.

## Temporary Anonymous Zone

A space dedicated to privacy and anonymity with information, discussions and experiences related to choosing what you reveal, where and when - both on and offline.

The Temporary Anonymous Zone will be an interactive educational hub where attendees can learn and explore concepts of privacy and anonymity. Join daily discussions on topics chosen by attendees, find information and conversation starters about privacy and anonymity basics, make a mask at our craft station, and get an invite to anonymously join a Devcon VI Semaphore group to access private and anonymous social experiences created just for the TAZ.
