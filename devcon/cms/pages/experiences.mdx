hacker_cave: >
  ## Looking for a place where you can test all the new tech and build? We got
  you covered!


  The hacker cave will be your high-focus zone away from the busy conference
  ado.


  It sets the right conditions for an individual to test new stuff on their
  laptop, to learn, or to hack on new ideas in a group.


  Everything a hacker needs will be taken care of: cozy seating, electricity and
  internet and, of course, cyberpunk lighting and low-fi beats to get you in the
  right mood to build!
