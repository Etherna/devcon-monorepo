  Remember, Devcon is one event taking place in one big venue. We discourage
  side events from taking place during Devcon days as they distract from the
  main event, though we welcome side events before and after Devcon.

  about: "## **Devcon Week**\n\n### Welcome to the Devcon Week calendar! Devcon is an intensive four-day conference packed with top-tier programming and experiences you don’t want to miss.\n\nThis calendar highlights selected events organized by the Ethereum community before and after Devcon. It doesn’t feature activities during Devcon days because Devcon has full-day programming.\n\n**Plan your trip to Bangkok**\L\n\nUse this calendar to decide when to arrive in Bangkok and maximize your Devcon experience. Check the schedule and the **[City Guide](/city-guide)** and start planning today.\n\n<Buttons\n  Button={[\n    { text: \"City Guide\", url: \"/city-guide\", color: \"orange-1\" },\n    { text: \"Get Tickets\", url: \"/tickets\", color: \"orange-1\" }\n  ]}\n/>\n"
