    # Devcon is an intensive introduction for new Ethereum explorers, a global
    family reunion for those already a part of our ecosystem, and a source of
    energy and creativity for all.


    Devcon is more than just a conference with talks and presentations. It’s a
    unique place for collaboration, where the brightest minds in Ethereum come
    together to share, innovate, and build. It's a space for learning and
    teaching, where the latest Ethereum technology is both showcased and
    demystified.

    # **Devcon 7 — Southeast Asia**


    # Devcon’s goal is to make Ethereum more accessible to communities around
    the world and to contribute to the ongoing evolution of the global Ethereum
    ecosystem.

    The Ethereum community in Southeast Asia holds immense potential to play a
    pivotal role in the global Ethereum landscape. You can see the evidence in
    its rapidly growing crypto adoption: Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia and
    Thailand are among the top 10 countries leading in the Global Crypto
    Adoption Index.

    Southeast Asia is a melting pot of diverse cultures, rich histories, and
    communities. While Bangkok Thailand, with its unique blend of tradition and
    modernity, serves as an ideal location to host Devcon in terms of both venue
    suitability and global accessibility, our intention is to bring the Devcon
    experience to the whole of Southeast Asia!
