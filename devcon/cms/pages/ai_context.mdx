  # **Devcon**
  Devcon is a recurring Ethereum conference, the largest
  and most impactful of its kind.

  Devcon is geared toward Ethereum's builders, creators, and thinkers who wish
  to improve this world. Programming at Devcon takes a holistic approach and
  aims to engage all attendees through talks, panels, workshops, lightning
  talks, and freeform learning sessions.

  This is the 7th edition of Devcon ("Devcon 7, Southeast Asia"), and it will be
  held in Thailand, Bangkok on November 12-15, 2024. While the event is held in
  Thailand, this edition of Devcon is designed to include the entirety of

  # Community Hubs

  We are pleased to announce the 14 selected Community Hubs for Devcon 7, chosen from a total of 34 proposals. While we initially planned for 9 hubs, the quality and diversity of submissions were so remarkable that we decided to expand to 5 additional hubs, making for a total of 14\.

  Each of these hubs will bring unique content and activities, ranging from deep technical discussions to creative collaborations and regional showcases. Below is the final list of accepted hubs, each of which will contribute something special to the Devcon 7 experience

  ## What are Community Hubs?

  Community Hubs are dedicated spaces that select communities and initiatives can, to a certain degree, shape on their own. This is an effort to make Devcon more decentralised by strengthening the influence the broader community has on participants’ experiences at the conference.

  They can be envisioned as informational booths that enhance the conference program by providing a space for attendees to drop by, ask questions, and learn about new aspects of Ethereum. Most importantly, please note that these spaces must not promote any single project or initiative; they must be purely educational.

  ## Preview of Accepted Community Hubs

  **Account Abstraction Hub**  
  Join forces to advance the Account Abstraction (AA) ecosystem, from SDKs and wallets to protocol standards like ERC-4337. Expect informal discussions and guided demos by AA experts, offering insights into how Account Abstraction can streamline user onboarding and enhance the Ethereum experience while staying true to its core values.

  **Adoption Hub**  
  A space for designers, researchers, and marketers to collaborate on driving Web3 adoption. This hub will feature workshops, mentoring, and UX audits focused on overcoming adoption challenges. You’ll walk away with actionable strategies to boost user trust, engagement, and community building in decentralized tech.

  # Devcon Satellites

  Devcon Satellite Events are an effort to decentralize Devcon, to give the opportunity to foster a community among those who can't make it to Bangkok due to distance, timing, cost, or other constraints, and to boost local Ethereum communities.

  Devcon Satellite Events range from just a simple get-together of friends watching the live streams with pizza, bigger meetups to rewatch the recorded keynote talks at a time that's better suited for your community, or a chance to recap and discuss Devcon updates with your local community after Devcon.

  These satellite events take place during or after Devcon Week, between November 11 \- December 8, 2024\. They are self-organized and totally independent.
