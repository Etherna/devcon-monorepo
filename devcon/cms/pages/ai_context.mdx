  ## **Devcon**
  Devcon is a recurring Ethereum conference, the largest
  and most impactful of its kind.

  Devcon is geared toward Ethereum's builders, creators, and thinkers who wish
  to improve this world. Programming at Devcon takes a holistic approach and
  aims to engage all attendees through talks, panels, workshops, lightning
  talks, and freeform learning sessions.

  This is the 7th edition of Devcon ("Devcon 7, Southeast Asia"), and it will be
  held in Thailand, Bangkok on November 12-15, 2024. While the event is held in
  Thailand, this edition of Devcon is designed to include the entirety of
  Southeast Asia.

  The Devcon event itself is from November 12-15, 2024. Devcon Week (as opposed
  to the main Devcon event) will span the entire week of November 9-17, and will
  include other events held by the community.

  There is currently no information on Devcon 8 and beyond, but more information
  will follow once Devcon 7 has concluded.

  Devcon will be streamed online.

  **Devcon app:**
  The Devcon app can be downloaded as a PWA on your phone at https://app.devcon.org. 

  On the Devcon app, you can view the schedule and speakers, watch livestreams, chat with the Devcon AI assistant, and more.

  ## Community Hubs:
  Community Hubs are dedicated spaces that select communities and initiatives can, to a certain degree, shape on their own. This is an effort to make Devcon more decentralised by strengthening the influence the broader community has on participants' experiences at the conference.

  They can be envisioned as informational booths that enhance the conference program by providing a space for attendees to drop by, ask questions, and learn about new aspects of Ethereum. Most importantly, please note that these spaces must not promote any single project or initiative; they must be purely educational.

  **Account Abstraction Hub**:
  Join forces to advance the Account Abstraction (AA) ecosystem, from SDKs and wallets to protocol standards like ERC-4337. Expect informal discussions and guided demos by AA experts, offering insights into how Account Abstraction can streamline user onboarding and enhance the Ethereum experience while staying true to its core values.

  **Adoption Hub**:
  A space for designers, researchers, and marketers to collaborate on driving Web3 adoption. This hub will feature workshops, mentoring, and UX audits focused on overcoming adoption challenges. You'll walk away with actionable strategies to boost user trust, engagement, and community building in decentralized tech.

  **Collective Intelligence Governance Hub**:
  Dive into the challenges and innovations in DAO governance design. Engage with governance experts from leading DAOs, discuss delegation, funding, and accountability, and harness collective intelligence to tackle governance issues in the Ethereum ecosystem.

  **Community Gardeners Hub**:
  A space for Ethereum community builders to share experiences, connect, and showcase global Ethereum initiatives. Explore regional Ethereum communities, learn effective community-building strategies, and find inspiration to grow your own local initiatives.

  **Onchain Creators Hub**:
  Explore the future of onchain creativity and how it can accelerate Ethereum's mainstream adoption. Through demos, workshops, and panels, you'll learn about new economic models and tools for onchain creators, making this an engaging space for both technical and non-technical participants.

  **Ethereum SEA Hub**:
  Celebrate the vibrant Ethereum communities in Southeast Asia. This hub will showcase the culture, achievements, and collaborations within the region, offering an interactive map of local projects and builders, and encouraging cross-collaboration opportunities.

  **GM Community Hub**:
  Led by builders from Africa, Asia, and Latin America, this hub highlights the unique challenges and innovations in Web3 across underrepresented regions. Engage in cross-cultural discussions and explore how blockchain technology is driving real-world change in the Global Majority.

  **Grants & Impact Hub**:
  A space for grant programs, researchers, and builders to collaborate on making Ethereum projects sustainable. Join workshops on optimizing grant proposals, measuring impact, and exploring alternative funding models to help you build lasting projects.

  **Hacktivism Hub**:
  Explore Ethereum's cypherpunk values, hacktivism culture, and how blockchain tools can address real-world issues like privacy, censorship, and human rights. Engage in discussions and workshops focused on putting Ethereum's core principles into practice, offering a hands-on exploration of its social impact and potential for change.

  **Home Operators Hub**:
  Focused on supporting home node operators and validators, this hub offers one-on-one troubleshooting, workshops, and discussions. Learn about running nodes with less than 32 ETH, privacy practices, and accessible staking solutions to help decentralize the Ethereum network.

  **Regen Hub**:
  Connect with builders focused on regenerative projects and sustainability within the Ethereum ecosystem. Discuss local empowerment, explore global regenerative initiatives, and learn how Ethereum can foster positive community impact.

  **Sustaining Open-Source Development Hub**:
  Explore the challenges and opportunities of open-source development in Ethereum. Discuss business models, developer engagement, and collaboration with the broader open-source community, and discover strategies to sustain open-source public goods within the ecosystem.

  **The World of DeSci Hub**:
  Learn about the decentralized science (DeSci) movement and how Web3 technologies are transforming science into a public good. Engage with global DeSci communities, explore new tools, and collaborate to reshape the scientific landscape using Ethereum.

  **Women in Web3 World (W3) Hub**:
  An inclusive space for women and allies to network, learn, and engage in conversations about diversity and inclusion in Web3. Participate in workshops, fireside chats, and wellness sessions, fostering collaboration and empowerment for women in the Ethereum ecosystem.

  ## Road To Devcon:

  The Road to Devcon (RTD) is a series of Ethereum events and educational initiatives leading up to Devcon, organized by the local communities in and near Southeast Asia.

  An initiative can be in the form of a meetup, university club, workshop, hackathon, grassroot community, local education initiative or project, other creative formats were also welcomed.

  To be eligible for a grant, your event should be:
  - Ethereum focused, streaming Devcon talks and programming
  - Free to attend 
  - Open to anyone
  - Not focused on investment, price or token sales
  - Has not already taken place

  Over 100+ events across 12 countries were supported under the Road to Devcon grant including India, the Philippines, Malaysia, Korea, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Cambodia, China, Vietnam, and Bhutan.

  ## Devcon Sattelites

  Devcon Satellite Events are an effort to decentralize Devcon, to give the opportunity to foster a community among those who can't make it to Bangkok due to distance, timing, cost, or other constraints, and to boost local Ethereum communities.

  Devcon Satellite Events range from just a simple get-together of friends watching the live streams with pizza, bigger meetups to rewatch the recorded keynote talks at a time that's better suited for your community, or a chance to recap and discuss Devcon updates with your local community after Devcon.

  These satellite events take place during or after Devcon Week, between November 11 - December 8, 2024. They are self-organized and totally independent.
