  # **Supporter Program**


  ## Help fund vital Ethereum projects and gain access to Devcon for your team


  ##### Supporters fund selected Ethereum-related public goods and receive
  Devcon tickets as a thank you for their support.


  The Devcon Supporter Program is a chance for teams and companies to get
  tickets for their team in bulk, without the hassle of buying tickets for the
  whole team in regular ticket sales. Devcon Supporters are often teams that are
  tokenized, have raised, and have the means to create impact through
  contribution.

      # **The Impact Forum**
      
      The Impact Forum is a dedicated space for Devcon attendees to meet teams working on important Ethereum projects, learn about the ecosystem, and connect with key contributors. The Forum promotes knowledge sharing and collaboration.
      
      ### You'll meet teams with a significant, positive influence on Ethereum and its community.
      
      Some Impact Teams and Supporters will be invited to join these spaces regardless of the amounts contributed. We want to ensure that the Impact Forum is about genuine contributions, not about branding, bringing together groups of all sizes that significantly impact Ethereum's ecosystem, culture, and future.
