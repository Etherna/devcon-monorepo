  ## **Supporters**


  ### Supporters are teams and organizations dedicated to the Ethereum community
  and its goals. In the Supporter Program, they contribute by funding selected
  Ethereum public goods. As a thank you for their support, we offer them easy
  access to Devcon with special Devcon Supporter tickets.

      ## **The Impact Forum**
      
      ### The Impact Forum is a dedicated space for Devcon attendees to meet teams working on important Ethereum projects, learn about the ecosystem, and connect with key contributors. The Forum promotes knowledge sharing and collaboration.
      
      ### You'll meet teams with a significant, positive influence on Ethereum and its community.

      **Impact Teams**
      
      The Devcon team will invite Impact Teams, who will get access to the spaces in the Impact Forum at no cost to interact with their peers, potential users, fellow builders, and other attendees. At many conferences, only teams with big budgets get representation. At Devcon, we donâ€™t have sponsorships. We want teams making a big impact on Ethereum to be present instead.
      
      **Supporters**
      
      Selected Supporter teams will be invited to join the Impact Forum as well. We want to ensure that the Impact Forum is about genuine contributions, not about branding, bringing together groups of all sizes that significantly impact Ethereum's ecosystem, culture, and future.
