  ## **Supporter Program**


  ### Supporters are teams and organizations dedicated to the Ethereum community
  and its goals. In the Supporter Program, they contribute by funding selected
  Ethereum public goods. As a thank you for their support, we offer them easy
  access to Devcon with Devcon Supporter tickets.

      **Impact Teams**
      
      The Devcon team will invite Impact Teams, who will get access to the spaces in the Impact Forum at no cost to interact with their peers, potential users, fellow builders, and other attendees. At many conferences, only teams with big budgets get representation. At Devcon, we donâ€™t have sponsorships. We want teams making a big impact on Ethereum to be present instead.
      
      **Supporters**
      
      Selected Supporter teams will be invited to join the Impact Forum as well. We want to ensure that the Impact Forum is about genuine contributions, not about branding, bringing together groups of all sizes that significantly impact Ethereum's ecosystem, culture, and future.

      ## **Presale Raffle-Auction**
      
      204 tickets will be offered in the Raffle-Auction this year. The highest 20 bids will win the Auction. Those who enter with the Minimum Bid or do not win in the auction will enter into the raffle and have a chance at winning one of 184 Devcon tickets being distributed. In this sense, we aim for the distribution outcome to be approximately 10% efficient and 90% fair.
