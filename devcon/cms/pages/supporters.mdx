  ## Help fund vital Ethereum projects and gain access to Devcon for your team


  ##### The Devcon Supporter Program is a chance for teams and companies to get
  tickets for their team in bulk, without the hassle of buying tickets for the
  whole team in regular ticket sales.

      # **Impact Teams**
      
      ##### Impact teams are projects that are working on making a difference with Ethereum. They are usually smaller and lack stable funding. They might be considered public goods!
      
      ##### &#xA;After a review and approval of their application, impact teams will receive 2 free tickets for their teams.

      # **The Impact Forum**
      
      The Impact Forum is a dedicated space for Devcon attendees to meet teams working on important Ethereum projects, learn about the ecosystem, and connect with key contributors. The Forum promotes knowledge sharing and collaboration.
      
      ### You'll meet teams with a significant, positive influence on Ethereum and its community.
      
      Some Impact Teams and Supporters will be invited to join these spaces regardless of the amounts contributed. We want to ensure that the Impact Forum is about genuine contributions, not about branding, bringing together groups of all sizes that significantly impact Ethereum's ecosystem, culture, and future.

      ## **Presale Raffle-Auction**
      
      204 tickets will be offered in the Raffle-Auction this year. The highest 20 bids will win the Auction. Those who enter with the Minimum Bid or do not win in the auction will enter into the raffle and have a chance at winning one of 184 Devcon tickets being distributed. In this sense, we aim for the distribution outcome to be approximately 10% efficient and 90% fair.
