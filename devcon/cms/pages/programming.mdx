      Devcon covers a wide range of Ethereum-related topics, from the base protocol, to its application layer, focusing on improvements made in each domain and real world impact these new technologies can have.
      
      Although the content is often technical, a lot of it remains accessible to most. Also, talks are ranked by level of technical difficulty so you can filter them based on your expertise, from newcomers to experts.

      curious about ways of improving the world through decentralisation.

      If you are already familiar with Ethereum, you will get an update on the
      state of Ethereum while reconnecting to its global, remote, community.


      Devcon is a unique experience to meet the builders of Ethereum, learn
      about the concrete use cases of this technology and their potential impact
      on our world.
