    ## **Overview**


    ### Programming at Devcon aims to engage technical and non-technical
    attendees with talks, panels, workshops, lightning talks, and freeform
    learning sessions.


    Devcon is a sponsor-free conference that aims at providing an unbiased
    overview of the state of Ethereum, its values, vision and directions.
    Speakers and talks are selected based on merit, not money.

      Devcon covers a wide range of Ethereum-related topics, from the base protocol, to its application layer, focusing on improvements made in each domain and real world impact these new technologies can have.
      
      Although the content is often technical, a lot of it remains accessible to most. Also, talks are ranked by level of technical difficulty so you can filter them based on your expertise, from newcomers to experts.
