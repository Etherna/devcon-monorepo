        Like we did for Devcon VI, we’ll again be featuring an on-chain Raffle-Auction as our first wave of tickets. We want to continue demonstrating the power of Ethereum to host provably fair and verifiable Raffles & Auctions, while increasing the methods we distribute tickets to the thousands that want to attend each year.
        
        A massive thanks to the Fairy & Archblock teams for dedicating their time to the success of this year’s iteration.

    text: "All proceeds from the Auction above the reserve price will be donated to public goods. If you bid above the reserve price but do not win in the auction, you will automatically be funneled into the Raffle for a ticket. \L\L\n\nIf you win the Raffle, you will be able to withdraw all funds above the Reserve price. If you do not win in either the Raffle or Auction, you will be able to withdraw all of your funds. \L\n\nLike last time, one lucky winner will receive a Golden Ticket to Devcon & will be able to withdraw all of their funds.\n"

    ### **Sybil Resistance**


    This year, we are working with Gitcoin Passport to add a secure
    sybil-resistance mechanism to the Raffle-Auction, thus ensuring that users
    are able to withdraw all of their funds if they do not win. You will need to
    log into your Passport OR create one & validate your stamps in order to
    participate in this year’s Raffle-Auction presale.

  - question: What are the policies towards Refunds & Transfers?
    answer: >
      **Refunds**


      All tickets will be refundable as long as the request is made before the
      start of the event. Refunds will be issued using the same payment method
      used to purchase the ticket: Credit card, ETH, or DAI. If the refund
      request is approved for a ticket paid for in cryptocurrency, you will be
      responsible for paying the gas fees of the transaction of the refund - gas
      fees will be deducted from the refunded amount. Please allow up to 4 weeks
      for refunds to be issued.


      **Transfers**


      In our effort to prevent scalping and ensure equal opportunity for all
      interested community members to be able to purchase tickets, we will only
      allow ticket transfers on a case-by-case basis upon written request to
      [support@devcon.org](mailto\:support@devcon.org). PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO
      BUY OR SELL A TICKET FROM AN EXTERNAL SOURCE — YOU RISK BEING SCAMMED.
  - question: Tickets are sold out - How can I attend?
    answer: >
      We will open up a Waiting List after our final wave of General Admission
      tickets have sold out. In the event of cancellations, tickets will be
      granted to those on the Waiting List in the order that they signed up. We
      strongly encourage anybody looking to purchase a ticket from a third party
      to do it through email & copy
      [support@devcon.org](mailto\:support@devcon.org).
