    ## **Raffle-Auction**


    **200 tickets** will be offered in the Raffle-Auction this year. **The
    highest 20 bids will win the Auction**. Those who enter with the Minimum Bid
    or do not win in the auction will enter into the raffle and have a chance at
    winning **one of 180 Devcon tickets being distributed**. In this sense, we
    aim for the distribution outcome to be approximately 10% efficient and 90%
    fair.


    A big thanks to the
    **[Fairy](https://fairyxyz.notion.site/Fairy-7f1b1725eff94829a9e50bd7c432aa8c)**
    & **[Archblock](https://x.com/archblock_)** teams for dedicating their time
    to the success of this year’s iteration.

      All proceeds from the Auction above the reserve price will be used to help
      people attend Devcon through funding programs like the **[EF Next Billion
      Scholars program](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/06/07/devcon7-scholars)**
      and other Devcon initiatives. If you bid above the reserve price but do
      not win in the auction, you will automatically be funneled into the Raffle
      for a ticket. If you win the Raffle, you will be able to withdraw all
      funds above the Reserve price. If you do not win in either the Raffle or
      Auction, you will be able to withdraw all of your funds. Like last time,
      one lucky winner will receive a free Golden Ticket to Devcon & will be
      able to withdraw all of their funds.

  - question: Can I purchase tickets with crypto?
    answer: >
      Yes — we will be accepting crypto payments (at minimum ETH or DAI) for
      tickets this year on a variety of networks.
  - question: What are the policies towards Refunds & Transfers?
    answer: >
      **Refunds**


      All tickets will be refundable as long as the request is made before the
      start of the event. Refunds will be issued using the same payment method
      used to purchase the ticket: Credit card, ETH, or DAI. If the refund
      request is approved for a ticket paid for in cryptocurrency, you will be
      responsible for paying the gas fees of the transaction of the refund - gas
      fees will be deducted from the refunded amount. Please allow up to 4 weeks
      for refunds to be issued.


      **Transfers**


      In our effort to prevent scalping and ensure equal opportunity for all
      interested community members to be able to purchase tickets, we will only
      allow ticket transfers on a case-by-case basis upon written request to
      [support@devcon.org](mailto\:support@devcon.org). PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO
      BUY OR SELL A TICKET FROM AN EXTERNAL SOURCE — YOU RISK BEING SCAMMED.
  - question: Tickets are sold out - How can I attend?
    answer: >
      We will open up a Waiting List after our final wave of General Admission
      tickets have sold out. In the event of cancellations, tickets will be
      granted to those on the Waiting List in the order that they signed up. We
      strongly encourage anybody looking to purchase a ticket from a third party
      to do it through email & copy
      [tickets@devcon.org](mailto\:support@devcon.org).
