    ## **Devcon VI Bogotá**


    ## Tracing our roots back to ÐΞVcon 0, a meetup of early Ethereum devs in
    Berlin, Devcon has grown into a global beacon for the Ethereum community,
    uniting voices, ideas, and innovations from across the world.


    At Devcon VI, we turned our spotlight to Latin America. The Road to Devcon
    VI was paved with \~14 events across the region, hosted by the passionate
    local communities of builders in Latam.
