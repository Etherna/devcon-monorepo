    ## Discover Ethereum and its community at Devcon!


    **Devcon is the Ethereum conference for developers, thinkers, and makers.
    Join Devcon and empower yourself to use and build decentralized systems.**


    Devcon is more than just a conference with talks and presentations. It’s a
    unique place for inspiration, where passionate builders, engineers,
    designers, researchers, community organizers, and artists come together to
    share updates and ideas. It's a space for learning and teaching, where the
    latest Ethereum technology is both showcased and demystified.


    Whether you're a seasoned Ethereum expert or just starting, Devcon is for
    you. It’s an intensive introduction for new Ethereum explorers, a global
    family reunion for those already a part of our ecosystem, and a source of
    energy and creativity for all.
