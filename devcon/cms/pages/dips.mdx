  about: "## **Contribute to Devcon**\n\n### Devcon Improvement Proposals (DIPs)\_are your chance to help improve Devcon. Suggest what we should include, change or subtract.\n\n**Inspiration:** DIPs are roughly inspired by the more decentralized PEP, BIP and [EIP processes]().\n\n**Goals:** We aim to use open and value-driven Ethereum tech where it makes sense and benefits all attendees. We want to encourage collaboration between different projects.\n\n**Request for proposals (RFPs):** Sometimes we post [RFPs](https://forum.devcon.org/c/devcon-rfps/5), which are specific ideas we'd love to see take place at Devcon.\n\n**How to submit a DIP:** [Write a short post on the Forum](https://forum.devcon.org/c/dip-discussion/6) and share your idea. We can discuss and iterate from there.\n\n**What happens then?** We will ask you to flash out the proposal and say what you need to make it happen. You'll make it official by posting it on GitHub, and after we accept the DIP, you can get started. Your team will receive Devcon tickets to bring your activation or integration to life. \n\n**Need inspiration?** Check the DIPs we have accepted in the past below! We prioritize proposals that are open-source, open to all attendees, value- and community-driven. Approval of proposals ultimately lies with the Devcon team.\n"
