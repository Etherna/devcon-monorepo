  about: "## **Contribute to Devcon**\n\n### Devcon Improvement Proposals (DIPs)\_are your chance to help improve Devcon. Suggest what we should include, change or subtract.\n\n**Inspiration: **DIPs are roughly inspired by the more decentralized PEP, BIP and [EIP processes]().\n\n**Goals: **We aim to use open and value-driven Ethereum tech where it makes sense and benefits all attendees. We want to encourage collaboration between different projects.\n\n**How to suggest a DIP: **[Write a short post on the Forum](https://forum.devcon.org/c/dip-discussion/6), and we can discuss it with the community.\n\n**Request for proposals (RFPs): **Sometimes we post [RFPs](https://forum.devcon.org/c/devcon-rfps/5), which are specific ideas we'd love to see take place at Devcon. \n\n**Need inspiration? **Check the DIPs we have accepted in the past below! We prioritize proposals that are open-source, open to all attendees, value- and community-driven. Approval of proposals ultimately lies with the Devcon team.\n"
