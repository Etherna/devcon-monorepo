questions:
  - question: Can I sponsor Devcon?
    answer: >
      Devcon has no sponsors, and no one can buy a speaking slot or
      representation at Devcon.


      We will have the "Devcon Supporters Program". If you want to receive
      details once we have them, please write us at supporters\@devcon.org.
  - question: What is the difference between Devcon and Devconnect?
    answer: "Devcon and Devconnect are the only two events organized by the Ethereum Foundation (yes, all the other amazing ETH events are community-run!). Both events are Ethereum-focused but serve different purposes.\n\nDevcon\_is a global Ethereum family reunion, a place to celebrate success and align on updates and direction. It is our principal event, all in one place with one big venue, and talks and workshops open to all.\_[Devcon SEA will take place in Bangkok, Thailand between 12-15 November 2024!\_](https://devcon.org/)\n\nDevconnect\_on the other hand, is a week to make progress, dive deep into specific topics among fellow experts, to co-work and collaborate. It is structurally entirely different from Devcon, and consists of many individual events, organized by you the community, that each cover one topic in depth.\n"
