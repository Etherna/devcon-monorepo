  ## **Bangkok: The city of angels**

      ### Bangkok is a place with striking contrasts, where ornate ancient temples like Wat Arun and Wat Phra Kaew and ultramodern skyscrapers coexist.
      
      ### Locals actually don’t commonly use the name “Bangkok”; they call their city “Krung Thep,” which translates to **"City of Angels"**.

      ###### Bangkok lies in the heart of the Chao Phraya River delta and has an intricate canal network, often referred to as the "Venice of the East". The river serves as a vital transportation route in Bangkok, with public water buses, cross-river ferries, and tourist boats as popular modes of transport. These boats offer great views of the palaces and temples along the river.
      
      ###### Bangkok's cuisine is world-famous, with street food, pad Thai, mango sticky rice, spicy tom yum soup, and more. The city’s green spaces, such as Lumphini Park, Bang Krachao the “green lung” of Bangkok, and Benchakitti Park directly next to the Devcon venue, offer an escape from the urban hustle.

  ## **Why Devcon Southeast Asia?**


  ### We call it Devcon Southeast Asia because the entire region deserves this
  significant Ethereum community event coming to their country. Ethereum
  communities in SEA are very active and many want to see Ethereum succeed.
  Ethereum has real use cases in SEA, with high crypto adoption in Vietnam, the
  Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand.


  But we can only gather in one location, and Devcon SEA will take place in
  Bangkok. Bangkok was selected for its low visa restrictions, excellent
  connectivity via Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) and Don Mueang International
  Airport (DMK), and abundance of hotels and side event spaces. The QSNCC is a
  huge, modern venue that has recently been renovated and is equipped to meet
  all of Devcon’s needs.

  ###### We can't wait for the global Ethereum community to meet Bangkok and the
  Ethereum communities of Southeast Asia!
local_experiences: "## **Local Experiences**\n\n### Bangkok as a city has lots to offer and explore! Temple tours, Thai cooking classes, traditional Muay Thai lessons, biking tours to explore hidden gems like Bang Krachao, and more! \L\n\n**Loy Krathong** is one of Thailand's most beautiful and significant festivals, celebrated annually on the night of the full moon of the 12th lunar month, typically in November. This year, it will be celebrated on **November 15th**, the last day of Devcon!\_\n\nThe festival involves floating decorated baskets (krathongs) on water to honor the river goddess Phra Mae Khongkha, symbolizing the letting go of negativity and making wishes for the future. In Bangkok, there are several popular places close to water to participate in Loy Krathong. One notable location is Benjakiti Park, conveniently located next to QSNCC, the Devcon venue!\n\n<Buttons\n  Button={[\n    {\n      text: \"Tourism Thailand Website\",\n      url: \"Tourism \",\n      color: \"orange-1\",\n      fill: false\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n"

      ### Bangkok’s traffic can get busy with many motorcycles on the roads. The public transport system of the BTS Skytrain and MRT is crucial to avoid traffic congestion and runs from early morning to midnight with high frequency. The Devcon venue is directly connected to the MRT stop “Queen Sirikit National Convention Center”.
    </>}
    right={<>
      You can conveniently use your Visa or Mastercard contactless credit card to tap in and out of MRT lines, whereas the BTS Skytrain requires cash for both single-journey tickets and refillable cards.
      
      ###### If you need a ride, the ride-sharing app [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/) is widely used and also offers food and grocery delivery.
