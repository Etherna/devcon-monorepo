Devcon is a recurring (every 1 to 2 years) Ethereum conference, the largest and most impactful of its kind.

Devcon is geared toward Ethereum's builders, creators, and thinkers who wish to improve this world. Programming at Devcon takes a holistic approach and aims to engage all attendees through talks, panels, workshops, lightning talks, and freeform learning sessions.

The Devcon event itself is from November 12-15, 2024. Devcon Week (as opposed to the main Devcon event) will span the entire week of November 9-17, and will include other events held by the community. 

This is the 7th edition of Devcon ("Devcon 7, Southeast Asia"), and it will be held in Thailand, Bangkok on November 12-15, 2024. While the event is held in Thailand, this edition of Devcon is designed to include the entirety of Southeast Asia. 

There is currently no information on future editions of Devcon, but more information will follow once Devcon 7 has concluded.
