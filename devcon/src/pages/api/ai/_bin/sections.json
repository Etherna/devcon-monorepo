DIPs focus on collaboration in the ecosystem between different projects.\n\nThe Devcon team also publishes Requests For Proposals (RFPs), which are specific ideas we'd love to see take place for the next Devcon edition.

Both events are Ethereum-focused but serve different purposes.\n\nDevcon is a global Ethereum family reunion, a place to celebrate success and align on updates and direction. It is our principal event, all in one place with one big venue, and talks and workshops open to all. [Devcon SEA will take place in Bangkok, Thailand between 12-15 November 2024! ](https://devcon.org/)\n\nDevconnect on the other hand, is a week to make progress, dive deep into specific topics among fellow experts, to co-work and collaborate. It is structurally entirely different from Devcon, and consists of many individual events, organized by you the community, that each cover one topic in depth.\n"
