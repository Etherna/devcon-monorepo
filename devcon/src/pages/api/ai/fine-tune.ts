    NOTES ON FINE TUNING:

        Need to keep a record of "bad results" from prompts, e.g. be able to see a before and after fine-tuning performance comparison
        Need an easy way to repeat prompts with before/after

        Need a workflow to manually verify training outcomes and train the ones that are still bad after the fine-tuning

        Notes: 

        "Also when you say “67% accuracy”, it sounds like you’re using fine-tuning as a way to provide it with a data set? This is probably not a good way to use fine tuning, as it doesn’t retain “memory” of the answer. It just makes the model more likely to respond in a certain manner (more verbose, more sarcastic, giving step-by-step instructions, etc). The fine tuning makes it hallucinate more towards a certain answer, so that might artificially increase your accuracy measure. Embeddings is usually a better solution for a knowledge base."

        Can we fine-tune fine-tuned models further? Or do we start from the same base model every time?
